|Oregon Measure 114: Sheriffs, police chiefs tell judge their agencies are ‘unprepared’ to support gun permit program|,|By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:45 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|,None,|Jason Myers, who retired as Marion County sheriff and now serves as executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, wrote to a judge in support of a temporary restraining order against Measure 114.Beth Nakamura || StaffNEW!By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations have submitted statements to a federal judge, saying their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114, which is supposed to take effect Thursday.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, on Friday submitted separate statements in support of a motion for a temporary restraining order against the new regulations filed by Oregon’s NRA-affiliate, the Oregon State Shooting Association, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.“Measure 114 placed a substantial amount of work on all law enforcement agencies but came with very little direction, no funding, and no additional staffing,” Myers wrote.What is the status of Measure 114?Their submissions to the court come as U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut is deciding whether to grant a temporary restraining order that would put the voter-approved measure on hold as four lawsuits proceed in federal court. The judge said she will issue a written ruling by Tuesday.Each suit argues the regulations violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, while the state attorney general’s office has defended the regulations as critical to stave off mass shootings and reduce suicides and homicides.The measure, which passed with 50.7% of votes, will require a permit to buy a gun; ban the sale, transfer or manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; and require background checks to be completed before a gun is sold or transferred.Both Myers and Campbell said they’ve been consulting with state police as the state police works to put a permit-to-purchase gun program in place by the measure’s effective date.During a court hearing Friday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall assured Immergut that Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit when the measure takes effect on Thursday, drawing laughter from gun rights advocates in the courtroom’s public gallery.State police said they have a draft of a permit application and expect to have a final one available on its website on Thursday.The state police provided the police chiefs and sheriffs associations with a draft permit application last week, but it hasn’t been finalized, Myers and Campbell wrote. State police also advised them that the permit program will be a “paper-heavy” process due to the state agency’s lack of an “electronic infrastructure,” they wrote.A paper process will require sheriff’s offices or police departments to mail or “courier” applications to the state police, Myers wrote, which he said will be time consuming and cause delays in issuing permits.Each also said they’re concerned there isn’t proper training available to meet the measure’s requirements.Under the measure, anyone applying for a permit to buy a gun must provide proof of specific firearms training, some of which can be done online and other parts through in-person demonstration.The training requires instruction on state and federal laws related to purchase, ownership, transfer, use and transportation of guns; safe storage of guns including reporting of lost and stolen firearms; how to prevent the abuse or misuse of firearms, including the impact of homicide and suicide on families, communities and the country; and a demonstration that the applicant knows how to lock, load, unload, fire and store a firearm before an instructor certified by a law enforcement agency.“OSSA is aware of no course in Oregon that has covered all these specific training requirements,” Myers wrote to the court.The sheriffs association “does not believe that anyone in the state will be able to certify that they have received training on each of these very specific subjects at this time,” he added.The sheriffs association and others now provide training required to get a concealed handgun license, but none address all the required training topics under Measure 114, according to Myers.The sheriffs association had opposed the measure when it went before voters.The sheriffs association has since organized a workgroup to recommend how best to put in place the required training, Myers wrote to the court.“Because it is unlikely that anyone can provide certification of training on these specific requirements, every person, including law enforcement officers wishing to obtain a permit, will first have to complete training that does not yet exist,” Myers wrote.Some smaller police agencies require their new officers to buy their own guns for use as duty weapons, wrote Campbell, of the chiefs of police association. But new officers won’t be able to buy a handgun without first getting the training and then a permit to make a purchase, Campbell wrote.“This is likely to cause serious disruption to some of our member agencies whose officers cannot obtain the necessary firearms to perform their police duties,” Campbell wrote. “At this moment, (the Oregon chiefs of police association) believes that there is no way a permit system using municipal police departments as the permitting agents can be operational by December 8th.’’Last week, Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner, president of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the association had invited chiefs to a Zoom meeting on Nov. 22 to discuss what’s needed for local police agencies to process applications to buy guns. He said the police chiefs have a lot of unanswered questions. The association forwarded the chiefs’ questions to the Oregon Department of Justice to try to get some guidance and clarity, he said.Immergut heard two hours of argument Friday, with much of the discussion centered around the measure’s ban on magazines with more than 10 rounds. Little discussion occurred in court about steps taken by the state to support a permit-to-purchase gun program.The judge has given parties to the pending four federal lawsuits until noon Monday to submit any friend of court briefs in support or against the pending motions for a temporary restraining order. She also said it’s entirely within her discretion the extent to which she considers any friend of the court briefs.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

Readers respond: Beavers’ Jack Colletto deserves the Heisman,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:01 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:00 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianThe 2022 football season is rapidly coming to a conclusion. Part of the concluding activities is the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to the outstanding player of the season. Historically, this award has gone to an outstanding quarterback whose team has ended the season in a high ranking position or the player who scores the most touchdowns.Oregon State University and The Oregonian/OregonLive should be pushing Jack Colletto for the Heisman. He certainly has been a most unique player among all teams during the last couple of years. Sure, he doesn’t play every down on offense, and he isn’t one of the leading scorers even in just the PAC-12 conference. However, he does play quarterback in critical situations, he is a quality linebacker on defense, he plays on four special teams and he is one of the best blockers on the team. His blocks often leave his opponents flat on their back, pancaked. He has scored many touchdowns on offense, as well as gained numerous first downs in short yardage situations. In short, this guy does everything.With a degree in engineering, he is no slug in the classroom either. If you put up all the other candidates for this award, Colletto has done what they have done, but they can’t do what he has done.Jack Colletto for Heisman!Dave Andress, DundeeTo read more letters to the editor, go to oregonlive.com/opinion.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Multnomah County public defender shortage leads to criminal cases dropped for alleged child beater, robbers, DUII drivers|,|By Aimee Green || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:12 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:00 a.m.|,185,|An empty room at the Multnomah County Central Courthouse in downtown Portland.Motoya Nakamura / Multnomah CountyNEW!185sharesBy Aimee Green || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe list of Multnomah County criminal cases dismissed this year because no public defenders were available to represent the accused is eye-opening, leaving victims awaiting justice that may never come:A visibly swollen and bruised 11-year-old girl who told Fairview police she didn’t want to go home because her mother kept beating her, including that night with a punch to the forehead.A Southeast Portland Plaid Pantry clerk hit in the head by a man who made off with six packs of cigarettes.A Portland area real estate agent who was struck by an alleged drunken driver, suffered seven broken bones and a collapsed lung and has been forced to retire before she was ready.Customers at a Gresham gas station chased around by a woman, with a meth pipe and a knife, who they say tried to set cars and gas pumps on fire with a lighter.A man who was enjoying a drink with friends at a Troutdale bar when investigators say another patron, who was drunk, accidentally shot him in the leg.A TriMet bus driver pepper-sprayed in the face by a passenger.The Oregonian/OregonLive combed through the list of 200-plus felony cases in Oregon’s most populous county dismissed by judges this year because there wasn’t a public defender to spare. While most involved defendants accused of stealing cars, fleeing police or illegally possessing guns, a small but significant swath encompassed face-to-face “person crimes,” where defendants were charged with beating, assaulting or threatening the safety of victims – sometimes even with knives or guns.Chris Day, the TriMet bus driver doused with chemical spray 10 months ago after he says he declined to drop off a passenger half a block before her stop, said it’s “disheartening” to see his case and so many others dismissed. He suspects the passenger had mental health and anger management problems, that without a criminal conviction, have gone unchecked.“The purpose of the court system is to get people the help they need,” he said, “and if they’re not getting the help, things are just going to get worse.”The list of closed cases shines a new and bright light on a long-simmering problem in Oregon and across many parts of the nation: Too few public defenders, too many cases, uncompetitive pay from the state and a system that all sides agree isn’t fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide adequate representation to defendants who can’t afford lawyers.The crisis reached a tipping point early this year, with circuit court judges in Multnomah County for the first time dismissing some cases as the already strained system bowed under increasing shootings, homicides, burglaries, robberies, car thefts and vandalism.The consequences are only now coming into full public view after Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt took the bold step two weeks ago of publicizing the complete list, pledging to update it each week until the situation is resolved. As of Friday, more than 220 defendants accused of felonies and 75 of misdemeanors have seen their cases dismissed since February because there weren’t enough public defenders.Schmidt hopes the attention will foster public understanding that the crisis has not only been hurting criminal defendants who vie for limited time with overworked attorneys, but the general public, too.Schmidt said he understands why judges have resorted to dismissing cases. But, he said, “it’s horrific. My attorneys are trying to explain this to a victim. It’s like, ‘Hey, sorry, your case was dismissed because the defendant didn’t have a lawyer.’ Where are the victim’s rights in that? …We are having to have a lot of awful conversations with people.”He said he’ll refile charges and prosecute all of the cases if the shortage resolves, and already he has had success reactivating a small number. But the future is uncertain. And the clock is ticking, with the statute of limitations for most felonies standing at three years and for most misdemeanors at two.!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();The problem isn’t isolated to Multnomah County. Circuit courts in about 10 of the state’s 36 counties are experiencing public defender shortages. The number currently stands at more than 700 defendants in need of representation. But unlike in Multnomah, by and large those courts haven’t resorted to dismissing cases – yet. The effect, however, is similar: With no lawyer for the defense, some criminal prosecutions have screeched to a standstill.Most notably, about 175 defendants in Washington County – the state’s second most populous county – have been charged and their cases remain open as they wait for an attorney.“To me, it’s a complete breakdown of the system,” said Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton. “The answer to this problem cannot be not prosecuting cases.”Meanwhile, Clackamas County, the state’s third largest county, has been able to avert the crisis so far for a variety of reasons, including a steady number of public defenders willing to work there.‘I’ll never be the same’The dropped cases in Multnomah County have left many victims feeling disillusioned.The Oregonian/OregonLive spoke to five, none of whom wanted to see the people who allegedly committed the crimes locked up simply in the name of justice.But they worried unprosecuted crime will lead to more crime when the perpetrators learn they won’t be sent to jail or prison or ordered into treatment. Under the best of circumstances – when the system is working as it should – defendants who are found guilty but not sent to prison are often connected with drug, alcohol and mental health treatment and sometimes even housing.Or in the case of intoxicated driving defendants, their licenses are suspended or revoked and they’re often ordered to listen to victims of impaired drivers talk about how the crashes devastated their lives.Carol Scalf's Toyota Camry was totaled in a Sept. 2021 crash in which prosecutors say a drunken driver sped into her head-on.Carol Scalf is disappointed to see the driver who struck her in fall 2021 go unprosecuted. On the day of the crash, Scalf, a real estate agent, had been dropping some flyers off at a home she’d listed for sale in North Portland and was driving back to her home in Gresham when prosecutors say an 18-year-old drunken driver struck her. It was shortly before 9 on a Sunday morning. He was charged in January with driving under the influence of intoxicants, reckless driving and assault for striking Scalf and another driver. He made his first court appearance in May but by August saw the case dismissed because the system couldn’t assign him a public defender.Scalf woke up in the intensive care unit with a fractured spine, ankle, ribs and a collapsed lung and a head injury. She said it has been a grueling and slow recovery – 14 months filled with doctors, chiropractor and physical therapy visits.“I’m still not recovered,” Scalf said. “I’ll never be the same again.”Although she was 75 at the time she was hit, she wasn’t planning on retiring any time soon. But she said she’s had to give up her career because of the crash. She also hasn’t been able to drive, because it’s physically and psychologically too much.The Oregonian/OregonLive isn’t naming the driver because a judge dismissed the case against him. Reached by phone, like other former defendants in this story, he declined comment.Multnomah County judges say they don’t want to dismiss cases, but they’re constitutionally obligated to when no lawyer is available to represent the accused.“It’s incredibly frustrating,” said Chief Criminal Judge Cheryl Albrecht. “The statute tells us we shall appoint counsel at the time of arraignment, not later.”TriMet bus operator Chris Day has been assaulted on the job four times.  In Feb. 2022 he was pepper sprayed in the face by a passenger.  The alleged perpetrator is not being prosecuted because Multnomah County doesn’t have a public defender to assign to the case.Dave Killen / The OregonianIn another case, Day, the TriMet bus driver, said just like Scalf he hasn’t been able to work, either. Day said the incident unfolded on the No. 9 line as he waited at a stop light in Gresham, and just as the light was about to turn green, a passenger asked to be let off. Day said he told the passenger he’d open the doors at the next stop, just on the other side of the intersection, but the passenger tried to kick the doors open, got her foot stuck in between them, then took out her fury on Day with the pepper spray. TriMet excluded the passenger from riding the system for 90 days.It’s the third time in 16 years of driving buses that Day said he’s been assaulted, and that doesn’t include a passenger who tried to smear blood on him. Day said he returned to work this spring, but felt uneasy. After spotting the accused passenger at one of the bus line’s stops, he knew he’d need to find another career. Day said his doctor and therapist signed off on putting him on disability.“It’s unbearable,” Day said. “How can I describe it? You don’t know when the next attack is going to come. And you don’t feel protected.”Carl Macpherson, executive director of Metropolitan Public Defenders, the state’s largest public defense firm, said the lack of attorneys for indigent clients is a public safety crisis that harms both defendants and victims. He said he understands why the Multnomah County District Attorney is spotlighting the issue by putting out the list.“I think he’s being open and transparent about the problem,” Macpherson said.Defendants in limboMany are trapped in legal purgatory as their cases are repeatedly delayed without a public defender appointed to represent them.Many players in the criminal justice system – prosecutors and public defenders alike – believe a driving force toward change would be pay parity. Metropolitan Public Defenders, for example, pays $64,000 to $95,000 a year while county prosecutors earn $98,000 to $196,000 annually.But more money would need to come from the state Legislature, because public defenders are paid for from state coffers. And the state entity most equipped to push the issue -- the Office of Public Defense Services and its oversight commission – have been in turmoil. In August, the commission ousted the office’s controversial executive director Stephen Singer.Businesses suffer, tooOf the cases dismissed this year in Multnomah County because of the public defender shortage, about 14% involved assaults or other crimes committed directly against people. Most by far – 53% – involved property crimes such as car thefts, vandalism or burglarized businesses.Jen Causey’s downtown Portland espresso bar, Lotus & Bean, falls into that category. Investigators say at about 4 a.m. this past July, a man who appeared amped up on drugs broke into a jewelry appraisal business on Southwest Third Avenue, then Causey’s coffee shop next door. Once inside, he emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher; tipped over a refrigerator, tables, chairs; threw a new $16,000 espresso maker onto the floor; shattered ceramic mugs and a glass door; and left blood from his cuts splattered across the floor. An arriving officer later wrote that virtually everything that could be broken was.Broken cups and equipment litter the floor of Lotus & Bean on July 18, 2022.“Honestly, I was just kind of shocked that one person could do all that,” Causey told The Oregonian/OregonLive.Causey said the man easily wreaked more than $50,000 in damage, which she said she’s thankful her insurance covered. But even so, the incident forced her to close for three weeks to clean up and wait for new equipment.She doesn’t, however, hold any ill will against the man who did it, whom she said she looked up on Facebook and discovered is middle-aged, has three children and has been in and out of rehab. But she wonders what will get him to return to drug treatment now that his court case has been dismissed.“He has a very significant addiction that needs to be addressed,” Causey said. “I want him to get some help.”It’s been a particularly tough year for Portland’s business community, which reports an onslaught of vandalism, thefts and property crimes against them. Just last month, startling numbers released by prosecutors show Portland police referred just 2% of theft cases to the district attorney’s office for prosecution because of their struggles to track down and build cases against the vast majority of suspects.Also last month, a co-founder of Salt & Straw ice cream shops said the company would move its Southeast Portland headquarters out of state if the city didn’t get a handle on crime. In response, Mayor Ted Wheeler held a summit this past week with business owners to talk solutions.Many of the cases on Multnomah County’s dismissed cases list would have never seen the light of day in a courtroom if it weren’t for chance discoveries by police.Case in point, a pair of thieves were caught on surveillance video breaking into Campfire Audio’s warehouse in inner Southeast Portland in March and making off with $240,000 of the high-end earphones the company manufactures.With police resources strapped, employees searched online sites and found their products for sale. A friend of an employee spotted a man selling their product out of the trunk of his car at a flea market. But it wasn’t until a month later that a Portland cop struck up a conversation with a suspect, noticed a pair of fancy earphones on him and then discovered thousands of dollars of the stolen earpieces in his truck.The man was charged with theft. But a few months later, a judge dismissed the case for lack of a public defender.Campfire Audio’s vice president, Caleb Rosenau, said while the burglary was like a punch to the gut, his company has significantly beefed up security and is here to stay. He just hopes police, prosecutors and the courts work out solutions – finding some way to hold offenders accountable. That might start with stable housing, mental health treatment and drug treatment to stop the need to feed their addictions, he said.“We’re very much not interested in moving,” Rosenau said, “because we care about the city and we want the city to get better.”!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

Letter from the Editor: An update on our ‘clean slate’ program,|By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:51 a.m.|,None,|The Oregonian and Oregon Journal archives are available online, and many articles remain available on OregonLive.NEW!By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLiveLast year, I announced The Oregonian/OregonLive would launch a “clean slate” program that allowed subjects of articles to ask us to review old news about minor crimes published on our website. Today, I want to update readers on that effort.To recap, we decided that the lasting effect of publicity for relatively minor scrapes with the law can create an unfair and outsized burden on someone trying to find a job or apartment.Our decision was guided by several factors: Unlike in the past, our archives remain available for many years through search engines; we used to report on minor crimes more often than we currently do and rarely followed up; and society has shifted toward a new approach to helping people rebuild their lives after a criminal conviction.Several other news organizations launched similar programs, notably our sister site Cleveland.com. The shift in society also has led to “ban the box” laws, which prohibit prospective employers from asking about criminal convictions early in the hiring process.Because communities of color are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, there is a racial justice component as well. The lingering existence of a mugshot online following an arrest for a minor crime can become an intractable impediment to gainful employment or housing for people who already face discrimination.Since we launched the review system in mid-2021, our internal committee of reporters and editors has resolved several dozen requests. Their decisions are based on news judgment, common sense and basic fairness.We have five main options when requests come in through our online form: leave things as is; remove a photograph, usually a jail booking mugshot; remove a name; ask Google to de-index the article, which makes it harder to find on OregonLive; or take an article down altogether.We generally won’t consider removing names or articles in the case of violent crimes, sex crimes or crimes against children. We also won’t remove names or stories in cases of public corruption or, at our discretion, in cases where people hold a position of public trust, such as doctors, police officers and schoolteachers.If someone got a court order to set aside a conviction, commonly referred to as expungement, we would weigh that as a factor but would not automatically remove the name or article.Politics and education editor Betsy Hammond helps lead the reviews with public safety editor Margaret Haberman. “Our committee members take this assignment seriously and often spend a long, thoughtful discussion weighing the trade-offs of taking stories down versus keeping them up,” Hammond said.The committee meets periodically, and Haberman said the review can be time-consuming. “Many of the requests have involved reporting, reading court records to check on the outcomes, calling people, verifying claims, which has caused delays in turnaround time,” she said.Here are a few requests and how the committee handled them:A young father addicted to drugs stole some outdoor furniture to feed his addiction in 2003. He moved out of state for a decade before realizing he had an arrest warrant pending. He turned himself in and did his time. Now addiction free, he asked that we remove the article and we did.A woman with mental illness who had stopped taking her medication asked that we remove a 2017 article about an altercation with police. “I take full responsibility for my actions that day and have taken steps to rectify and atone for what transpired,” she wrote. “Today I can proudly say that I have landed back on my feet and was able to procure a stable job.” We removed it.The easiest issue that comes to the newsroom involves jail booking photos. We stopped publishing such photos for routine cases some time ago, and subsequently Oregon law changed to strictly limit the public release of such photos by law enforcement.Such photos are a great example of what we are trying to address: a snapshot of someone’s worst moment, often related to a minor crime, which might end up dismissed, pleaded down or sealed. Yet the demeaning photograph lives on and on and on, just one keyboard search away.We’re very likely to agree to remove booking photographs, given our current practice of not using them unless, say, police release a photo in hopes of apprehending a fugitive.“The process also shows again and again that many of the requests deal with the types of stories we no longer do -- because of their minor nature, because we no longer cover the metro area at that level of detail in all things and because we’ve changed how we cover public safety and handle photos,” Haberman said.Here is the form to request a reviewHammond said some requests were surprising. “We expected people accused of convicted of low-level crimes to request journalistic clemency after a period of years, and they have. But other requests have been quite different.”For instance, The Oregonian used to highlight top students at metro area high schools, writing profiles of them for a feature called Academic Achievers. We receive occasional requests to remove that information due to privacy concerns, problems with stalkers or the wish that the date of their high school graduation not be so public.In another case, a trans person reached out to have a former name removed. “Deadnaming” refers to the use of a name a trans or nonbinary person previously used, such as their birth name. We updated the name.In another, the widow of a man who died in an accident years ago asked that her young children’s names be removed from the article. We agreed to do so.Since the launch of our clean slate program, we haven’t agreed to every request. We declined to remove an article about a man who stabbed his wife. We did agree, in a separate case, to remove the names of children, now grown, mentioned in an article about a man convicted of killing their mother.We said no to a local businessman who had been sentenced to prison for dodging taxes and denied another person’s request to remove an article about a sex abuse conviction involving a minor.We expect the program will continue to evolve as we receive more requests, but we’re pleased with results so far.Our journalism needs your support.

Liz Weston: Remarried divorcee considers claiming ex’s survivor benefit,By Liz Weston ,Business,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|Liz Weston, personal finance columnistNEW!By Liz Weston Dear Liz: I was told by Social Security that because I remarried at 60, I could still collect half of my ex’s benefits once he died. He has just died, and half of his benefit is greater than my own retirement benefit. My current husband has not started benefits. If I collect half of my ex’s benefit but want to later switch to collecting benefits on my current husband’s record (once he starts to collect) or to survivor benefits should he die before I do, can I do that?Answer: The short answer is yes, although you’ve confused divorced spousal benefits with divorced survivor benefits.While your ex was alive, you might have been eligible for a divorced spousal benefit if you had remained unmarried. That benefit would have been up to 50% of your ex’s primary insurance amount (the amount he would receive at his full retirement age).The rules changed once your ex died. As a divorced survivor who remarried after age 60, you are entitled to up to 100% of what your ex was receiving. The survivor benefit will be reduced if you haven’t yet reached your full retirement age (which is currently between age 66 and 67).Survivor benefits also offer more flexibility to switch later than other types of benefits. If you choose to begin receiving a surviving divorced spouse’s benefit now, you can switch to your own benefit at any point through age 70, if your benefit is higher, says William Meyer, founder of the Social Security Solutions claiming strategies site. You also can switch to receiving spousal benefits from your current spouse’s record once he starts collecting, if that benefit is greater than what you’re receiving from your former spouse’s record.Figuring out the right way to claim can be tricky, so consider consulting an advisor or using claiming strategy software to determine what’s best in your situation.Liz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for NerdWallet.

Readers respond: Take Multnomah County’s gas stove report with grain of salt,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianYour electric stove is 3.4 times more likely to cause a deadly home fire than a gas one. That’s an attention-grabbing first sentence. So is “your gas stove can make you and your children sick,” the first sentence in a recent news article on OregonLive (“Gas stoves are hazardous to your health, Multnomah County report says,” Nov. 10).Of those two sentences, only one is supported by conclusive data - the first one.The Multnomah County report should be subject to scrutiny and its findings challenged. Instead, its conclusions become headlines and soundbites; part of a public relations campaign aimed at persuading the public to accept bans on gas hookups and appliances.In another recent study, GTI Energy concludes that cooking on an electric range may have a greater adverse impact on indoor air quality than cooking on a gas one. As with the Multnomah study, further research is needed.That eye-opening stat about fire deaths comes from an objective study of fire data by the National Fire Protection Agency. Missing from that report is any suggestion that electric stoves be banned, and rightly so.Low-carbon fuels like natural gas and propane and an increasing array of ultra-low carbon renewable fuels such as renewable propane can help decarbonize communities while alleviating strain on an overburdened electric grid.We should focus more on that story and take each story about an agenda-driven study with a grain of salt.Tucker Perkins and Matt SolakPerkins is president and chief executive of Propane Education & Research Council.

Latest Oregon Measure 114 developments: What is the status of challenges to new gun limits?,By The Oregonian/OregonLive.com,Politics,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:54 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:35 a.m.|,None,|A controversial provision of Oregon Ballot Measure 114 is its ban on high capacity magazines.Jacob Hamilton file photo || For MLive.comNEW!By The Oregonian/OregonLive.comOregon’s strict new gun control limits will go into effect Thursday as things currently stand. However, that could change as early as Monday.A federal judge last week heard arguments on the first court challenge to Oregon Measure 114. After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled Dec. 8.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Background check backlogMeantime, Oregon State Police announced that any background check not resolved by Thursday would be held in place until a prospective gun buyer completed the permit requirement put in place by Measure 114. Then, OSP said, the background check process would resume.As of Saturday, Oregon State Police had 42,000 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.OSP's Update on the status of Firearms Instant Check System transactions in the Pended/Delayed Queue as it relates to BM114 - Oregonhttps://t.co/ybYwDa2Nlq pic.twitter.com/QUhT8PrVio— Oregon State Police (@ORStatePolice) December 2, 2022

Increased salesStores like Cabela’s in Tualatin are reporting more gun sales than usual.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” said store manager Richard Dziedzic. The store can handle about 80 people a day for gun sales. He said there was a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m. and the queue was full for the day by the time the store opened at 9 a.m.Permit systemIf the measure becomes state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Thursday. Marshall represented Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, whose office is defending the measure’s constitutionality.The courtroom’s public gallery erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.Many law enforcement authorities have said they are working diligently on a system but do not see any way to have fully operational before the law’s enactment date. Additionally, they say the permit system will take resources away from other policing functions.On Friday, the heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations said their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, submitted the statement in support of one of the four lawsuits pending.A new permit application is in “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.Current court challengesThe Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. That challenge was the subject of Friday’s hearing.Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association.A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday. The newly filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.High capacity ammoOne flashpoint is the measure’s ban on magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for other recreational purposes such as hunting, as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.Many Oregon sheriffs have said, if this provision becomes law, they would not place a high priority on enforcing it.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Editorial: Kafoury should leave surplus Multnomah County homeless funds to next board to spend,By The Oregonian Editorial Board,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:27 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:30 a.m.|,None,|Tents are a common sight in the Old Town neighborhood in downtown Portland.  April 30, 2021. Beth Nakamura/StaffThe OregonianNEW!By The Oregonian Editorial BoardMultnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury is developing plans to spend $28 million in surplus housing and homelessness funds in advance of a Dec. 15 board of commissioners meeting. The outgoing chair should instead drop the matter from the agenda and leave the decision for the 2023 board to take up next month.It’s inappropriate for Kafoury to take the lead for such a significant investment just two weeks before her term ends, and her continued bickering with Portland leaders over homelessness initiatives only prolongs our intergovernmental dysfunction. To best position Chair-elect Jessica Vega Pederson for success and acknowledge residents’ widespread frustration with the status quo, Kafoury should gracefully give authority for spending this windfall to those who will have to be accountable for it.We suggested this course of action in an editorial last month, as Portland city officials sought county support for Mayor Ted Wheeler’s plan to create six sanctioned sites for homeless campers. But the need for Kafoury to step back has become even clearer after she sent a letter to Portland city officials last week that could only be read as an attempt to thwart their long-overdue response to the homeless crisis. While City Council’s approval of the plan means Portland will redirect $8 million of the $45 million that it pledged to the county for the Joint Office of Homeless Services, Kafoury’s letter warning of potential impacts was both misleading and revelatory of her flawed understanding of how a “joint” office should operate.In the letter, Kafoury writes that the city’s cut would “require one-time funding to cover shelter operations at the River District Navigation Center and Wy’East Shelter for the remainder of the fiscal year.”That wording, however, is overly prescriptive. As county spokesman Denis Theriault wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, the $8 million is part of the city’s overall allocation, which funds existing shelter, rehousing and street outreach programs. The city did not specify which programs should be cut, and so Kafoury had the Joint Office develop recommendations. By highlighting the navigation center, backed by business interests, and Wy’east Shelter, which serves veterans, it appears Kafoury sought to generate additional pressure on city leaders – a tactic that thankfully did not dissuade City Council from voting yes last week.Certainly, Kafoury is right that losing that $8 million will affect some Joint Office programs if the county does not backfill those dollars. But again, Kafoury does not come clean. As Willamette Week’s Nigel Jaquiss reported, the county budgeted nearly $19 million for spending on shelter, outreach and safety for the 2022 fiscal year that ended June 30, but spent only $9.7 million. So, while Kafoury may legitimately complain that the city is pulling the $8 million from its pledged dollars, the Joint Office failed to spend what the county and city agreed upon. Theriault noted difficulties in hiring for outreach jobs, delays in shelter conversions and other issues, but the fact remains that the county did not invest as it promised to.The letter is misleading in other ways. Kafoury writes that the city has failed to indicate whether it plans to permanently shift $8 million from its Joint Office allocation. She lists several other programs that she says could be cut, if so.But the current City Council cannot bind future City Councils in their annual funding decisions. So, the question posed by Kafoury is one that no one can responsibly answer.And the reality is that the city and county’s funding of the joint office already changes from year to year, sometimes dramatically. The potential for beloved programs or governmental services to be cut is always present, depending on the health of the economy and other factors. In recent years, there’s been more money than anticipated due to strong tax revenue, but that could easily go the other direction if the country falls into recession, as many economists are predicting.Of course, there’s no guarantee that the 2023 board of commissioners would commit any funds to the city’s sanctioned campsites, though Vega Pederson and Commissioner Sharon Meieran have expressed support for the concept. Currently, about half of the Joint Office’s total spending already goes to emergency and temporary shelter. But while the office has funded some small-village type operations and traditional congregate venues, it is spending heavily on converting former motels into shelters – a great option for a limited number of people but a prohibitively expensive way to meet the needs of the thousands living on Portland streets. The Portland plan, while imperfect, recognizes that we need solutions that help a greater share of those thousands. That has not been a priority for Kafoury, who has long viewed permanent housing as the best use of available dollars.There’s no year-end deadline by which the board of commissioners must allocate those funds. There’s no reason the new board can’t take this up in January with Vega Pederson at the helm and her designee, former state. Sen. Diane Rosenbaum, temporarily filling her vacant District 3 seat prior to a special election. Rather, there’s every reason that the county should turn over a new page in its partnership with the city as soon as possible.If Kafoury won’t cede this decision to the next board, the four other commissioners should stand united in insisting on it. They should make clear-eyed decisions on what’s best for the future of the county, and not be pressured into giving Kafoury one last say.-The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board

Opinion: Undoing urban growth boundary isn’t the answer to our housing crisis,|By Guest Columnist || The Oregonian|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:16 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:15 a.m.|,None,|We don’t need to compromise our principles and sacrifice farms and forestlands to development to confront the housing crisis, the authors write. Oregonian file photoLC-NEW!By Guest Columnist || The OregonianSam Diaz, Kim McCarty and Steve MessinettiDiaz is executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon. McCarty is executive director of Community Alliance of Tenants. Messinetti is president and chief executive for Habitat for Humanity Portland Region.In his Nov. 12 column, “Need for housing exceeds all boundaries,” Steve Duin proposes that we address Oregon’s housing crisis by undoing the urban growth boundary. But simply opening up all of Oregon to development won’t solve our housing crisis, though it will exacerbate other challenges in the process. His “solution” will not result in housing options near existing schools, parks, jobs, stores and services that most Oregonians can afford.The urban growth boundary is an innovative policy for designating land for development that continues to achieve its goals of preventing climate-harming and congestion-inducing sprawl while protecting land that grows our food and offers us moments in nature. While improvements can be made to how local governments expand the boundaries, the main problem we face is a lack of equally innovative policies that support the development needed inside our existing urban footprint. Building housing has become more complicated with more expensive and lengthy permitting and land use processes. For many projects, the jurisdictional fees surpass the cost of the land. For example, when Habitat for Humanity develops housing in our region, permitting fees plus “System Development Charges” paid to local jurisdictions generally exceed the market-rate cost for land.Cities across the United States with no urban growth boundaries or zoning - including Houston, Dallas, and Boise - are experiencing similar housing shortages as Portland. Furthermore, previous expansions of the urban growth boundary in the Portland metro region have led to developments of more expensive homes on large lots far from jobs and public transportation - not the places affordable to live in that are so desperately in demand. The takeaway? The urban growth boundary isn’t the make-or-break lever for housing supply or affordability.If turning farms, forests and watersheds into subdivisions won’t solve our housing crisis, what will? We need a comprehensive approach that includes stabilizing renters at risk of eviction, land use policies that encourage density near jobs and transportation, funding to close racial disparities in home ownership, fast-track permitting and fee waivers to encourage affordable housing, and increasing availability of underutilized land within urban growth boundaries.Keep people housed. Expanding the urban growth boundary will not stop evictions and homelessness. The single most cost-effective way to address houselessness is to help prevent people from losing their homes in the first place. Portland State University’s Homeless Research and Action Center forecast at least 125,000 Oregon households at risk of eviction in 2021. It’s already happening – since January, monthly eviction filings have surged with hundreds more a month than in pre-pandemic times. In addition to increased rental assistance, we should look to offer free legal assistance for tenants; support small landlords; enact stronger renter protections; and encourage full utilization of our currently vacant housing.Promote balanced approaches to infill in all neighborhoods and welcome more neighbors. Oregon has landmark legislation to allow duplexes, triplexes and other multi-unit homes in all neighborhoods. Housing density near jobs, transit, schools, services, and community spaces reduces carbon emissions, makes transportation cheaper and more accessible and adds to the diversity and vibrancy of our neighborhoods. To help spur increased development, every jurisdiction should waive fees associated with development and streamline permitting for affordable housing development, with state and federal support when necessary.Give more Oregonians the opportunity to own their home. Even moderately priced housing options are out of reach for many people, especially for Oregonians of color and younger families, many of whom are scrambling to keep up with skyrocketing rents. A path forward is to restrict more properties to be permanently affordable through the community land trust model. In combination with a dedicated revenue stream from the state and local jurisdictions for down payment assistance and subsidies for affordable housing development, this model can facilitate homeownership for households earning low and moderate incomes.Locate and leverage land within the urban growth boundary. Look around our own cities and towns. We have large areas of vacant lands, underused parking lots and empty commercial spaces, all available for building homes. Portland has recently proposed to inventory City-owned land and make all appropriate parcels shovel-ready for affordable housing. Other public agencies should do the same.We don’t need to sacrifice our natural areas or farmland to meet the housing challenge. The real keys to unlocking housing supply and affordability lie within our urban growth boundaries.

Cowlitz tribe’s gamble: Campaign to keep rivals to ilani casino at bay raises questions  ,|By Jeff Manning || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Business,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:04 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|The ilani Casino Resort near Ridgefield, Washington, on Wednesday.Dave Killen / The OregonianNEW!By Jeff Manning || The Oregonian/OregonLiveSince 2016, the Cowlitz Indian Tribe has paid millions to a Portland consulting firm and its owners to protect its highly successful ilani Casino Resort from unwanted competition — namely other tribes looking to expand their gaming operations in Oregon.Ilani became the nearest casino to Portland when it opened in 2017 outside La Center, Washington, and it now boasts annual revenue of at least $300 million a year, according to one estimate.Gaming is vital to Northwest tribal economies and, in this case, access to the highly lucrative gambling market in Oregon’s population center was at stake.Cowlitz leaders turned to consultants Matthew Rossman and Bruce Studer and their company — best known for a nearly two-decade quest to build the state’s first private, non-tribal casino over the objections of tribes in Oregon. At the urging of an influential tribal leader, the late David Barnett, the tribe entered into a contract paying from $30,000 to $50,000 a month to R&S Strategy Group or its owners, Rossman and Studer.Editor's note
This story was produced through a collaboration between The Oregonian/OregonLive and Underscore News. A future installment will explore a lawsuit in Washington state that could upend tribal gaming and, experts say, threaten the U.S. government's recognition of tribal sovereignty.According to a copy of the agreement and records of tribal meetings, as well as interviews with Rossman, the tribe aimed to stave off competitors, particularly the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon.Gaming dollars have been transformative for some tribes, funding various social programs. Casinos also have made some players in the business extremely wealthy. And few pursued the tribal gaming motherlode as aggressively as Barnett, who died in May at age 61.Barnett’s father was a tribal chair who led the Cowlitz to securing federal recognition, and the younger Barnett played key roles in securing the tribe’s land and getting ilani built. He, too, was elected in 2020 as chair of the tribe’s general council, its top leadership post.Barnett brokered a series of agreements between the tribe and Rossman and Studer, or at times with their company, R&S Strategy Group. Documents outline the arrangement in broad strokes, saying they would work to protect the ilani from competitors without specifying how.The agreements included a clause that forbade the would-be casino developers from moving forward with a private casino that would compete with ilani. And if the pair did develop a casino, the Cowlitz tribe would have the option to manage it for them.Thousands lined up for the grand opening of the ilani Casino Resort on April 24, 2017.Stephanie Yao Long/The Oregonian (file)Rossman told The Oregonian/OregonLive that Barnett wanted to expand the Cowlitz tribe’s gambling operations into Oregon. He said the contract gave the Cowlitz tribe first right of refusal to run any casino Rossman and Studer developed if their campaign was successful.“The goal was for the tribe to have a presence in Oregon,” Rossman said. “The majority owner would have been the Cowlitz, or Dave (Barnett).” Rossman added that the consulting agreements were reviewed and approved by outside law firms.Barnett worked zealously to advance the tribe’s gaming interests — though attorneys hired by the tribe warned his own interests were too closely intertwined, according to tribal documents. They also said Barnett promoted a culture of fear within the tribe. The tribe’s attorneys wrote in a 2021 report that Barnett had threatened members with lawsuits, violence or banishment.The Cowlitz declined to talk to The Oregonian/OregonLive about the agreement and the tribe’s goals.However, Cowlitz leaders and their attorneys have privately raised numerous questions about the deal, according to tribal records obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive.Some questioned why the tribe was paying so much and what it was getting in return.While declining to comment further, Cowlitz officials said the tribe had severed ties with Rossman and Studer.“The tribe has a duty to review and evaluate its contracts when issues are raised,” the tribe said in a statement. “Following that review, a decision was made to end the contractual agreement with R&S.”Orlando Moreno, a former manager of the Cowlitz tribe and an enrolled member of the Arizona-based Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, said he objected to the contract when he first joined the Washington tribe’s administration in 2020. The Cowlitz seemed to be getting little of value, he said. More broadly, the notion of one tribe launching a secret effort to undercut others offended him.“We have an unwritten agreement,” Moreno said. “At the end of the day, we’re all Indian Country. We support each other.”Contentious backdropCowlitz tribal leaders’ moves are playing out against the backdrop of significant changes in tribal gaming in Oregon.Increasingly, tribes in Oregon are challenging the status quo, particularly the policy set out by recent governors that tribes can only operate one casino located on their respective reservations. The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, operator of the Chinook Winds casino in Lincoln City, is pushing hard for permission to open a second casino in Salem. The Coquille Indian Tribe on Oregon’s south coast wants to build a casino in Medford.The Grand Ronde, which operates the Spirit Mountain Casino & Lodge, said it has no interest in expanding and remains an advocate of current state policy — one casino per tribe on their respective reservations, said Justin Martin, a Grand Ronde tribal member and its lobbyist in Salem.The Grand Ronde publicly opposed the ilani project. In 2010, it filed an ultimately unsuccessful appeal of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s decision to approve it, claiming that the casino was located outside traditional Cowlitz territory and arguing that the tribe was not federally recognized in 1934, a key test under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. A federal appeals court, however, found the tribe was nonetheless “under federal jurisdiction.”People play slot machines on the gaming floor of the ilani Casino Resort on the day it opened, Monday, April 24, 2017Stephanie Yao Long/The Oregonian (file)Grand Ronde officials were surprised when informed of the Cowlitz’s efforts that appeared to be aimed at the Oregon tribe.“It’s obviously disappointing and absolutely the opposite of the open and transparent policy we strive for,” Martin said. “Whether or not it’s legal, it’s just smarmy.”Tribes, forcibly relocated onto reservations, have closely guarded their legal franchise on casino gambling to fund health clinics, childcare centers and other services. Some give proceeds to tribal members in what is called a per-capita distribution.The nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon have organized against efforts to legalize private, non-tribal gaming in the state, including ballot initiatives led by Rossman and Studer.The duo has tried at least four times since 2005 to get voter approval to amend the constitution to allow private casinos. They managed to get their initiative on the ballot in both 2010 and 2012 and lost by wide margins in both. They scuttled a 2020 effort due to the pandemic.Travis Boersma, the billionaire co-founder of Dutch Bros Coffee, sought this year to open a casino-like gambling hall at a horse track in Grants Pass over objections from tribes. Boersma argued the operation was exempt because it was tied to racing, but shuttered the whole operation when the state denied a key operating permit.And there are nationwide threats to gaming as an economic tool for tribes. A case before a federal court in Washington state challenges the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which sets out a procedure for regulating gaming on Indian land. If the challengers succeed, they could open the door to private, non-tribal casinos nationwide — and weaken the very underpinnings of tribal sovereignty.Barnett’s visionBarnett went to high school in the blue-collar logging town of Aberdeen, Washington. He was a gifted distance runner — he never lost a race in four years — and got a scholarship to compete at the University of Washington. He eventually found his niche as a real estate developer.He kept his eye on the ultimate prize — a tribal casino.Indeed, ilani has been a watershed for the 5,000-member Cowlitz tribe, which claims ancestral lands that stretch from the Cowlitz River south to the Columbia. As recently as 2000, the tribe — which declined to sign treaties with the U.S. government in 1855 — was not federally recognized and had no reservation.Barnett’s father played an important role in the effort to secure federal recognition. The son was determined the tribe should take the next logical step – construction of a casino. Even Barnett’s staunchest critics give him credit for making ilani happen. He sold the land to the tribe where the Casino now stands. But Barnett also stood to benefit from the casino financially.David Barnett, a leader of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, laid the groundwork for what would become its ilani Casino Resort near La Center, Washington. He was photographed in 2004 as the tribe unveiled its plans.Joel Davis/The Oregonian (file)In 2004, years before the Cowlitz tribe had formally reclaimed any of its ancestral lands, Barnett’s company, Salishan Co., entered into a development agreement to build the resort casino that would become ilani in partnership with the powerful Mohegan Tribe, an experienced operator based in Connecticut. (Salishan Co. has no relation to Salishan Resort on the Oregon coast.)According to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed by the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, a publicly traded arm of the tribe, ownership of the company that would control and operate the casino was split three ways — nearly half to a Mohegan company, 40% to Barnett’s company, and the balance, 10.85%, to the Cowlitz tribe.By the spring of 2017, ilani was on the verge of opening its doors. But there was a last-minute snag. The National Indian Gaming Commission informed the Cowlitz and Mohegan that it wouldn’t approve the ilani management agreement because of concerns over Barnett’s conduct, according to SEC filings and a 2020 lawsuit the Mohegan filed against Barnett’s Salishan Co.It’s unclear what conduct the commission was concerned about.But Barnett could be erratic and aggressive, not hesitating to verbally abuse other members of the Cowlitz tribal government. Audio and video of a tribal gaming commission meeting in 2016 captured his profanity-laced tirades directed at tribal members who opposed him.He had brushes with law enforcement, including a 2009 incident in which he suffered a traumatic brain injury after he was thrown from the back of a pickup truck driven by his then-girlfriend.The woman told deputies she was attempting to flee in Barnett’s truck after an argument. Barnett, from the moving vehicle’s open truck bed, was attempting to break through the back window when he fell out onto the pavement.Barnett wasn’t charged with a crime, but three weeks after the crash, he told deputies that if they had tested his blood they likely would have detected alcohol and drugs, according to a police report.Barnett would continue to fight substance abuse issues off and on for the rest of his life. After his death last May, the cause was widely reported as a heart attack. It was actually “acute fentanyl intoxication,” according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.“It became apparent that issues in Mr. Barnett’s personal background would likely render him, along with any entity in which he held an interest, unsuitable for involvement in the management of the ilani casino,” the Mohegan said in its 2020 lawsuit filed against Barnett’s Salishan Co.Ultimately, Mohegan bought out the share owned by Barnett’s Salishan Co. On April 17, 2017, Mohegan agreed to pay $114.8 million over several years.Details of the buyout were included in the 2020 lawsuit as the Mohegan casino operators sought to pause payments to Barnett’s company during the pandemic, which had temporarily shut down the casino. The two sides settled the lawsuit in August 2020. The terms were not disclosed.Controversial strategyBarnett’s proposal to bring on R&S Strategy Group was controversial from the start.Documentation and audio from a 2016 meeting of the Cowlitz Tribal Gaming Authority make plain that members worried about the public relations black eye they could suffer if the agreement leaked. They also thought the consultants were asking too high a price for their lobbying work.“I think the Oregon tribes are going to come together and fight this,” said authority board member Carolyn Medeiros. “And the $30,000 a month is stupid.”Adding to their qualms was the fact that Barnett had already paid $30,000 out of his own pocket. Now he was urging the tribe’s gaming commission members to adopt the contract itself, assume the monthly payments and repay his expense.Barnett raged against dissenters, according to the audio, and heaped praise on R&S for its political savvy.“They work with a lot of legislators,” Barnett said. “They’ve got connections. They’re not nobodies. … You should be thanking me for getting us in front of this thing.”Barnett wanted the council to act fast, saying he worried Rossman and Studer had approached the Grand Ronde. Barnett warned gaming board members that Rossman and Studer could sign a deal with the Grand Ronde if the Cowlitz didn’t hire them.The Spirit Mountain Casino in Grand Ronde, operated by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, was the closest to the Portland metro area before the Cowlitz Indian Tribe opened its ilani Casino Resort in southwest Washington. Cowlitz tribal leaders hired Oregon consultants who had campaigned to overturn the state's prohibition of non-tribal casinos to protect their investment from competition, including from Grand Ronde and other tribes.Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian (file)Martin, the Grand Ronde lobbyist, confirmed that Rossman and Studer did approach the Grand Ronde about consulting. He said his tribe was not interested.Barnett prevailed, and the Cowlitz tribe signed an agreement with R&S Strategy Group in late 2016.According to tribal documents and a copy of the contract, the tribe agreed to pay $30,000 a month for 36 months followed by a $500,000 balloon payment at the contract’s expiration.In November 2020, the tribe entered into another memorandum of understanding with Rossman and Studer personally. This time, the contract called for the tribe to pay $50,000 a month over 42 months.It’s not totally clear what the Cowlitz Tribe got in return. The intervening years brought no major changes in Oregon’s tribal gaming landscape. Rossman declined to get into specifics but said the tribe got its money’s worth. Studer did not respond to questions.But concerns among tribal leaders grew, coming to a head at an Oct. 24 meeting of the Cowlitz Tribal Council. According to the council member who spoke to The Oregonian/OregonLive, those concerns included whether the tribe’s efforts could violate federal laws against blocking competition.Four attorneys from Orrick, a prominent national law firm, attended the meeting, according to an attendance list provided to The Oregonian/OregonLive. Among them were two antitrust specialists from the firm’s offices in Washington, D.C., and Houston, and a Seattle-based white-collar crime specialist.It’s unclear why the tribe would consult antitrust attorneys. Under the Sherman Act, antitrust laws are intended to curtail business arrangements that would fix prices or reduce competition on grounds these arrangements are generally bad for consumers.But the Sherman Act generally comes into play when competitors conspire to divvy up a market or fix prices — and no other tribe was involved in the Cowlitz deal.Rossman and Studer, whose agreement with the tribe instigated the debate, don’t operate a casino. Their campaign to change Oregon state laws remains a longshot bid.“Working to keep a competitor out of the market is fundamentally anticompetitive,” said Dan McCuaig, a private practice attorney in Washington, D.C., who spent nearly a dozen years prosecuting antitrust cases for the U.S. Department of Justice. “But if the other company in the agreement isn’t really a competitor, there’s no antitrust case.”Asked about those issues, Cowlitz officials again declined to comment. Rossman also declined to address that specific issue.The late October meeting was not the first time concerns were raised about the relationship with the consultants. The law firm Quarles & Brady advised the tribe in a 2021 written report that Barnett’s conduct in awarding the consulting contract with R&S Strategy Group should be investigated internally.“To be clear, there is no evidence that Barnett committed any federal criminal offenses,” the Quarles & Brady report states. “However, the alleged facts surrounding his dealings with R&S, his dual roles on tribal council and in development projects, and the federal funding the tribe receives raises serious concerns that warrant further investigation or disclosure to federal authorities.”It’s unclear whether the tribe pursued those concerns.Tribal leadership issued a memo to members in recent days advising them not to discuss or disclose tribal matters publicly.But several tribal members and former employees told The Oregonian/OregonLive that they hoped speaking up would end what they called a culture of bullying and fear.“Tribal leadership has forgotten where we came from. This is not our way,” said Robin Ladue, a 68-year-old retired psychologist and tribal member. “This is about honesty and integrity.”-- Jeff Manning; jmanning@oregonian.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Letter from the Editor: An update on our ‘clean slate’ program,|By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:51 a.m.|,None,|The Oregonian and Oregon Journal archives are available online, and many articles remain available on OregonLive.NEW!By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLiveLast year, I announced The Oregonian/OregonLive would launch a “clean slate” program that allowed subjects of articles to ask us to review old news about minor crimes published on our website. Today, I want to update readers on that effort.To recap, we decided that the lasting effect of publicity for relatively minor scrapes with the law can create an unfair and outsized burden on someone trying to find a job or apartment.Our decision was guided by several factors: Unlike in the past, our archives remain available for many years through search engines; we used to report on minor crimes more often than we currently do and rarely followed up; and society has shifted toward a new approach to helping people rebuild their lives after a criminal conviction.Several other news organizations launched similar programs, notably our sister site Cleveland.com. The shift in society also has led to “ban the box” laws, which prohibit prospective employers from asking about criminal convictions early in the hiring process.Because communities of color are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, there is a racial justice component as well. The lingering existence of a mugshot online following an arrest for a minor crime can become an intractable impediment to gainful employment or housing for people who already face discrimination.Since we launched the review system in mid-2021, our internal committee of reporters and editors has resolved several dozen requests. Their decisions are based on news judgment, common sense and basic fairness.We have five main options when requests come in through our online form: leave things as is; remove a photograph, usually a jail booking mugshot; remove a name; ask Google to de-index the article, which makes it harder to find on OregonLive; or take an article down altogether.We generally won’t consider removing names or articles in the case of violent crimes, sex crimes or crimes against children. We also won’t remove names or stories in cases of public corruption or, at our discretion, in cases where people hold a position of public trust, such as doctors, police officers and schoolteachers.If someone got a court order to set aside a conviction, commonly referred to as expungement, we would weigh that as a factor but would not automatically remove the name or article.Politics and education editor Betsy Hammond helps lead the reviews with public safety editor Margaret Haberman. “Our committee members take this assignment seriously and often spend a long, thoughtful discussion weighing the trade-offs of taking stories down versus keeping them up,” Hammond said.The committee meets periodically, and Haberman said the review can be time-consuming. “Many of the requests have involved reporting, reading court records to check on the outcomes, calling people, verifying claims, which has caused delays in turnaround time,” she said.Here are a few requests and how the committee handled them:A young father addicted to drugs stole some outdoor furniture to feed his addiction in 2003. He moved out of state for a decade before realizing he had an arrest warrant pending. He turned himself in and did his time. Now addiction free, he asked that we remove the article and we did.A woman with mental illness who had stopped taking her medication asked that we remove a 2017 article about an altercation with police. “I take full responsibility for my actions that day and have taken steps to rectify and atone for what transpired,” she wrote. “Today I can proudly say that I have landed back on my feet and was able to procure a stable job.” We removed it.The easiest issue that comes to the newsroom involves jail booking photos. We stopped publishing such photos for routine cases some time ago, and subsequently Oregon law changed to strictly limit the public release of such photos by law enforcement.Such photos are a great example of what we are trying to address: a snapshot of someone’s worst moment, often related to a minor crime, which might end up dismissed, pleaded down or sealed. Yet the demeaning photograph lives on and on and on, just one keyboard search away.We’re very likely to agree to remove booking photographs, given our current practice of not using them unless, say, police release a photo in hopes of apprehending a fugitive.“The process also shows again and again that many of the requests deal with the types of stories we no longer do -- because of their minor nature, because we no longer cover the metro area at that level of detail in all things and because we’ve changed how we cover public safety and handle photos,” Haberman said.Here is the form to request a reviewHammond said some requests were surprising. “We expected people accused of convicted of low-level crimes to request journalistic clemency after a period of years, and they have. But other requests have been quite different.”For instance, The Oregonian used to highlight top students at metro area high schools, writing profiles of them for a feature called Academic Achievers. We receive occasional requests to remove that information due to privacy concerns, problems with stalkers or the wish that the date of their high school graduation not be so public.In another case, a trans person reached out to have a former name removed. “Deadnaming” refers to the use of a name a trans or nonbinary person previously used, such as their birth name. We updated the name.In another, the widow of a man who died in an accident years ago asked that her young children’s names be removed from the article. We agreed to do so.Since the launch of our clean slate program, we haven’t agreed to every request. We declined to remove an article about a man who stabbed his wife. We did agree, in a separate case, to remove the names of children, now grown, mentioned in an article about a man convicted of killing their mother.We said no to a local businessman who had been sentenced to prison for dodging taxes and denied another person’s request to remove an article about a sex abuse conviction involving a minor.We expect the program will continue to evolve as we receive more requests, but we’re pleased with results so far.Our journalism needs your support.

Latest Oregon Measure 114 developments: What is the status of challenges to new gun limits?,By The Oregonian/OregonLive.com,Politics,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:54 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:35 a.m.|,None,|A controversial provision of Oregon Ballot Measure 114 is its ban on high capacity magazines.Jacob Hamilton file photo || For MLive.comNEW!By The Oregonian/OregonLive.comOregon’s strict new gun control limits will go into effect Thursday as things currently stand. However, that could change as early as Monday.A federal judge last week heard arguments on the first court challenge to Oregon Measure 114. After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled Dec. 8.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Background check backlogMeantime, Oregon State Police announced that any background check not resolved by Thursday would be held in place until a prospective gun buyer completed the permit requirement put in place by Measure 114. Then, OSP said, the background check process would resume.As of Saturday, Oregon State Police had 42,000 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.OSP's Update on the status of Firearms Instant Check System transactions in the Pended/Delayed Queue as it relates to BM114 - Oregonhttps://t.co/ybYwDa2Nlq pic.twitter.com/QUhT8PrVio— Oregon State Police (@ORStatePolice) December 2, 2022

Increased salesStores like Cabela’s in Tualatin are reporting more gun sales than usual.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” said store manager Richard Dziedzic. The store can handle about 80 people a day for gun sales. He said there was a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m. and the queue was full for the day by the time the store opened at 9 a.m.Permit systemIf the measure becomes state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Thursday. Marshall represented Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, whose office is defending the measure’s constitutionality.The courtroom’s public gallery erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.Many law enforcement authorities have said they are working diligently on a system but do not see any way to have fully operational before the law’s enactment date. Additionally, they say the permit system will take resources away from other policing functions.On Friday, the heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations said their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, submitted the statement in support of one of the four lawsuits pending.A new permit application is in “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.Current court challengesThe Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. That challenge was the subject of Friday’s hearing.Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association.A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday. The newly filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.High capacity ammoOne flashpoint is the measure’s ban on magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for other recreational purposes such as hunting, as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.Many Oregon sheriffs have said, if this provision becomes law, they would not place a high priority on enforcing it.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Editorial: Kafoury should leave surplus Multnomah County homeless funds to next board to spend,By The Oregonian Editorial Board,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:27 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:30 a.m.|,None,|Tents are a common sight in the Old Town neighborhood in downtown Portland.  April 30, 2021. Beth Nakamura/StaffThe OregonianNEW!By The Oregonian Editorial BoardMultnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury is developing plans to spend $28 million in surplus housing and homelessness funds in advance of a Dec. 15 board of commissioners meeting. The outgoing chair should instead drop the matter from the agenda and leave the decision for the 2023 board to take up next month.It’s inappropriate for Kafoury to take the lead for such a significant investment just two weeks before her term ends, and her continued bickering with Portland leaders over homelessness initiatives only prolongs our intergovernmental dysfunction. To best position Chair-elect Jessica Vega Pederson for success and acknowledge residents’ widespread frustration with the status quo, Kafoury should gracefully give authority for spending this windfall to those who will have to be accountable for it.We suggested this course of action in an editorial last month, as Portland city officials sought county support for Mayor Ted Wheeler’s plan to create six sanctioned sites for homeless campers. But the need for Kafoury to step back has become even clearer after she sent a letter to Portland city officials last week that could only be read as an attempt to thwart their long-overdue response to the homeless crisis. While City Council’s approval of the plan means Portland will redirect $8 million of the $45 million that it pledged to the county for the Joint Office of Homeless Services, Kafoury’s letter warning of potential impacts was both misleading and revelatory of her flawed understanding of how a “joint” office should operate.In the letter, Kafoury writes that the city’s cut would “require one-time funding to cover shelter operations at the River District Navigation Center and Wy’East Shelter for the remainder of the fiscal year.”That wording, however, is overly prescriptive. As county spokesman Denis Theriault wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, the $8 million is part of the city’s overall allocation, which funds existing shelter, rehousing and street outreach programs. The city did not specify which programs should be cut, and so Kafoury had the Joint Office develop recommendations. By highlighting the navigation center, backed by business interests, and Wy’east Shelter, which serves veterans, it appears Kafoury sought to generate additional pressure on city leaders – a tactic that thankfully did not dissuade City Council from voting yes last week.Certainly, Kafoury is right that losing that $8 million will affect some Joint Office programs if the county does not backfill those dollars. But again, Kafoury does not come clean. As Willamette Week’s Nigel Jaquiss reported, the county budgeted nearly $19 million for spending on shelter, outreach and safety for the 2022 fiscal year that ended June 30, but spent only $9.7 million. So, while Kafoury may legitimately complain that the city is pulling the $8 million from its pledged dollars, the Joint Office failed to spend what the county and city agreed upon. Theriault noted difficulties in hiring for outreach jobs, delays in shelter conversions and other issues, but the fact remains that the county did not invest as it promised to.The letter is misleading in other ways. Kafoury writes that the city has failed to indicate whether it plans to permanently shift $8 million from its Joint Office allocation. She lists several other programs that she says could be cut, if so.But the current City Council cannot bind future City Councils in their annual funding decisions. So, the question posed by Kafoury is one that no one can responsibly answer.And the reality is that the city and county’s funding of the joint office already changes from year to year, sometimes dramatically. The potential for beloved programs or governmental services to be cut is always present, depending on the health of the economy and other factors. In recent years, there’s been more money than anticipated due to strong tax revenue, but that could easily go the other direction if the country falls into recession, as many economists are predicting.Of course, there’s no guarantee that the 2023 board of commissioners would commit any funds to the city’s sanctioned campsites, though Vega Pederson and Commissioner Sharon Meieran have expressed support for the concept. Currently, about half of the Joint Office’s total spending already goes to emergency and temporary shelter. But while the office has funded some small-village type operations and traditional congregate venues, it is spending heavily on converting former motels into shelters – a great option for a limited number of people but a prohibitively expensive way to meet the needs of the thousands living on Portland streets. The Portland plan, while imperfect, recognizes that we need solutions that help a greater share of those thousands. That has not been a priority for Kafoury, who has long viewed permanent housing as the best use of available dollars.There’s no year-end deadline by which the board of commissioners must allocate those funds. There’s no reason the new board can’t take this up in January with Vega Pederson at the helm and her designee, former state. Sen. Diane Rosenbaum, temporarily filling her vacant District 3 seat prior to a special election. Rather, there’s every reason that the county should turn over a new page in its partnership with the city as soon as possible.If Kafoury won’t cede this decision to the next board, the four other commissioners should stand united in insisting on it. They should make clear-eyed decisions on what’s best for the future of the county, and not be pressured into giving Kafoury one last say.-The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board
