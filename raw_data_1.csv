Spectators flock to Hawaii’s erupting Mauna Loa volcano,The Associated Press,Environment,"Nov. 30, 2022, 11:26 a.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 11:25 a.m.",0,"Ingrid Yang, left, and Kelly Bruno, both of San Diego, take a photo in front of lava erupting from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022, near Hilo, Hawaii. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe first eruption in 38 years of Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is open 24 hours a day.“The viewing has been spectacular,” especially at night and before sunrise, park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane said.Visitors to the park are currently able to witness two eruptive events: the glow from Kilauea’s lava lake and lava from a Mauna Loa fissure.“This is a rare time where we have two eruptions happening simultaneously,” Ferracane said.Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. The current eruption is its 34th since written history began in 1843. Its smaller neighbor, Kilauea, has been erupting since September 2021.Officials were initially concerned that lava flowing down Mauna Loa would head toward the community of South Kona, but scientists later assured the public the eruption had migrated to a rift zone on the volcano’s northeast flank and wasn’t threatening communities.The lava was flowing “not super fast” at less than 1 mph, Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said Tuesday. It was moving downhill about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Saddle Road, which connects the eastern and western sides of Hawaii’s Big Island.The flow was likely to slow down about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from the road, when it hits flatter ground.It was not clear when or if the lava will reach the road. It could hit flatter ground later Tuesday or Wednesday, according to Hon.The smell of volcanic gases and sulfur was thick Tuesday along Saddle Road, where people watched the wide stream of lava creep closer. Clouds cleared to reveal a large plume of gas and ash rising from a vent on the mountain.Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation to allow responders to arrive quickly or limit access as needed.Lava crossed the Mauna Loa Observatory access road Monday night and cut off power to the facility, Hon said. It could move toward the county seat of Hilo, he added, but that could take a week or longer.Meanwhile, scientists are trying to measure the gas emitted from the eruption.“It’s just very early in this eruption right now,” Hon said.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",205,"'1':202 '10':224 '1843':140 '1984':128 '2021.officials':150 '2022':28 '24':65 '30':27 '34th':134 '38':43 '4':248 '6':222 '6.4':250 'abl':90 'access':338,346 'accord':281 'account':409 'activ':52 'ad':369 'allow':331 'along':293 'ap':32 'apnew':35 'arriv':334 'ash':316 'associ':38 'assur':171 'began':138 'big':239 'bruno':6 'bull':34 'charg':209 'clear':262,307 'closer':305 'cloud':306 'communiti':164 'communities.the':192 'compens':421 'concern':153 'connect':230 'could':273,360,372 'counti':364 'creep':304 'cross':341 'current':89,130 'cut':351 'david':324 'day':68 'diego':10 'downhil':220 'draw':55 'earli':393 'eastern':232 'emerg':328 'emit':385 'erupt':18,41,94,119,126,131,147,175,388,396 'especi':74 'event':95 'facil':356 'fast':198 'ferracan':83,122 'first':40 'fissur':109 'flank':187 'flatter':258,275 'flow':156,195,241 'front':15 'gas':314,384 'gase':287 'glow':97 'ground':276 'ground.it':259 'happen':120 'hawaii':20,31,58,237 'hawaiian':212 'head':161 'hilo':30,367 'histori':137 'hit':257,274 'hon':205,357,399 'hon.the':283 'hour':66 'ige':325 'ingrid':1 'initi':152 'island.the':240 'issu':326 'jessica':82 'kelli':5 'ken':204 'kilauea':99,144 'kilomet':225,251 'kona':167 'lake':102 'larg':311 'largest':51 'last':125 'later':170,277 'lava':17,101,104,155,193,267,303 'left':3 'less':200 'like':243 'limit':337 'link':414 'loa':23,47,108,124,159,344 'longer.meanwhile':377 'mauna':22,46,107,158,343 'may':419 'measur':382 'migrat':177 'mile':223,249 'monday':348 'mountain.gov':323 'move':219,361 'mph':203 'nation':60 'near':29 'needed.lava':340 'neighbor':143 'night':76,349 'northeast':186 'nov':26 'observatori':214,345 'one':411 'open':64 'park':61,80,87 'peopl':297 'photo':13 'photo/gregory':33 'plume':312 'power':353 'pressth':39 'proclam':329 'product':404 'public':173 'purchas':402 'quick':335 'rare':113 'reach':269 'receiv':420 'regist':406 'respond':332 'reveal':309 'rift':180 'right':397 'rise':317 'road':228,254,271,295,347 'saddl':227,294 'said':215,358 'said.if':400 'said.mauna':123 'said.visitors':84 'san':9 'scientist':169,207,378 'scientist-in-charg':206 'seat':365 'septemb':149 'side':235 'simultan':121 'sinc':135,148 'site':417 'slow':245 'smaller':142 'smell':284 'south':166 'spectacular':73 'spokesperson':81 'stream':301 'sulfur':289 'sunris':79 'super':197 'take':11,373 'thick':291 'threaten':191 'time':114 'toward':162,362 'tri':380 'tuesday':216,278,292 'two':93,118 'vent':320 'view':70 'visitor':56 'volcan':286 'volcano':24,53,59,184,213 'wasn':189 'watch':298 'wednesday':25,280 'week':375 'western':234 'wide':300 'wit':92 'world':49 'would':160 'written':136 'yang':2 'year':44 'zone':181",
"4 Idaho students were killed in ‘targeted attack,’ authorities say: ‘We’re going to solve this’",Tribune News Service,Pacific Northwest,"Dec. 02, 2022, 3:21 p.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 11:11 a.m.",0,"Flowers, a stuffed animal, and a framed image featuring the photos of the four people found dead at a house on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho, rest in the snow in front of the house on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022. The university will be holding a system-wide vigil, Wednesday evening, Nov. 30, 2022 in memory of the students, as investigators continue to look for a suspect and motive in the killings. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)APNEW!By Tribune News ServiceFollowing back-and-forth claims from law enforcement on the fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students last month, the Moscow Police Department on Thursday night doubled down on claims the attack was targeted, though they acknowledged the house itself and not its occupants may have been chosen by the still-unidentified killer.The police department restated its belief that the Nov. 13 attack was targeted after investigators on Wednesday said they “do not currently know if the residence or any occupants were specifically targeted.”“We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants,” the department said in a statement.“We continue receiving inquiries about comments made by Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson, who said the suspect(s) specifically looked at the victim’s residence and that one or more of the occupants were undoubtedly targeted. The Moscow Police Department is the only provider of official information regarding this case.”Moscow Police Chief Jim Fry on Thursday explained why police have held back information from the public regarding the investigation into the Nov. 13 murders of four University of Idaho students.Fry also expressed confidence that the team of investigators will solve the case, even though no suspect has been identified yet.Nearly three weeks after Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle were killed in their off-campus residence, little information has been shared to answer questions like how the suspect got into the residence, who specifically was targeted and why other roommates were spared.Fry said when that information is made public, the killer may learn that information, too, which could jeopardize the case. It also might jeopardize the integrity of a trial if an arrest is made.“We’re always going to hold stuff back as much as we possibly can because when you’re talking about the integrity of the case, you’re talking about when this goes to trial, have you tainted jurors?” he said during an interview with the Moscow-Pullman Daily News. “There’s a way bigger picture here than just people knowing. Because for it to be a fair trial, you have to have people who don’t know facts and have already made up their own opinions on them.”Fry confirmed to the Daily News on Thursday that his department still stands by its earlier statements that this was a targeted attack. In an interview with CNN, Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell clarified the recent news release by saying investigators “have not concluded if the target was the residence or its occupants.”As of Wednesday night, 113 pieces of physical evidence have been collected and taken to the Idaho State Police crime lab. More than 260 tips have been submitted to the FBI.That evidence includes DNA from the crime scene, but Fry said he does not yet know when the lab will release the results of that testing. Fry said the police have done “many, many” interviews with people and will continue to follow every lead.Dealing with this evidence, he said, is a time-consuming task that has contributed to the length of this investigation.“I think people need to realize that these things take time in order to get the evidence processed and processed properly without destroying it or contaminating it,” he said. “It takes time to do that.”Fry said he knows the community has become impatient with the pace of the investigation, but he said the collection and processing of the evidence is being done correctly.“I understand people are frustrated with that, but in the end, when you have a rock-solid case, that’s what matters,” he said.He said the hours that passed between when the murders likely happened and the 911 call that was placed just before noon Nov. 13 has not hindered the investigation. Police learn how to adapt to circumstances they cannot change when working a case.“We get dealt the hand we’re dealt, and then we move forward from that point on,” he said.When asked when this case, if it continues to go unsolved, becomes a cold case, Fry expressed confidence it won’t come to that.“I’m not even going to speculate on that, No. 1, because that’s not even in my mind,” he said. “We’re going to solve this. We’re going to continue to work until we solve it.”He called the investigative team made up of Moscow police, FBI and Idaho State Police an “incredible working group.”“There’s no ego,” he said. “We have a focus, we have a job to do and we’re going after the answers to this.”Fry said any tips from the public get sent to the tip line, where staff review them. He said there has been discussion about offering a reward for information leading to an arrest. Fry said while that may happen in the future, police are not ready to do that yet.The Moscow police issued a news release Thursday evening that said they are aware of a sixth person listed on the lease of the King Road residence, but they don’t believe that person was present during the murders.--The Spokesman Review in Spokane and the Moscow-Pullman Daily News contributed.If you purchase a

Dear Doctor: Is there a link between dementia or  nightmares and use of statins?,Dr. Keith Roach,Health,,"Nov. 29, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: I am 64. I started taking statins to lower my cholesterol about two years ago. My cholesterol level sometimes went over 200, and after seesawing results, my doctor advised that I was unable to maintain a low cholesterol by diet alone and prescribed a statin. I took 10 mg of atorvastatin. I noticed I started having very detailed and vivid nightmares. (I would rather be awake than be in these nightmares.) The doctor changed me to 5 mg of rosuvastatin. The doctor says my results are very good (cholesterol is 140). I am still having nightmares, but not as frequent as before. I also am having memory issues (e.g., could not remember the names of close colleagues from only two years ago). I recently saw an article that suggested there may be a link between dementia and use of statins.Can you provide comments on nightmares and/or dementia links to statins? -- H.L.ANSWER: Large-scale studies in people at high risk for, or with, heart disease suggest that statins reduce the incidence of dementia by about 15% to 30%. This may be due to their reduction of strokes, which can cause dementia, but may also worsen function in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Or it may be due to statins’ ability to reduce amyloid protein in the brain. These effects are postulated and not confirmed by trials specifically designed to look at dementia.On the other hand, there are certainly people who can develop forgetfulness on statin drugs. This side effect seems to be much more common in people taking simvastatin (Zocor) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) than pravastatin (Pravachol) or rosuvastatin (Crestor). Unlike dementia, the side effect of worsened memory halts when the medicine is stopped.I found a few case reports of nightmares associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin, but a literature review found no correlation between nightmares and statins. The problem with studies like these is that they are not likely to find rare side effects. It is certainly possible the simvastatin caused the nightmares (and I’m not sure if the rosuvastatin is, too), but it seems to be a very unusual side effect.DEAR DR. ROACH: I have someone close to me who was having chest pains and back pains for about a month. This person went to the ER, where they did an EKG and a chest X-ray, and they also took blood tests. Everything came back looking good. The person was told they have acid reflux (which is understandable because my friend hasn’t been eating right), but about 40 minutes later, my friend got a call saying something else showed up and that their white blood cells are low (2.1). Any reason for concern? -- B.E.ANSWER: The normal range for a white blood cell count is from about 3.5 to about 11. (That’s actually 3,500 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter.) When we see white blood cell counts that low, we generally repeat them to be sure there wasn’t an error, and if persistent, your friend should visit a regular doctor or hematologist (blood expert). There are many possibilities: Medications and infections are common causes. A familial condition called “Duffy-null” produces low white cell counts, but doesn’t cause problems such as recurrent infections. Unfortunately, low white cell counts can sometimes indicate a severe bone marrow problem, so your friend does need to get an evaluation if the repeat test still shows a very low count.Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Readers respond: Sanctioned homeless camps won’t work,Letters to the editor,Opinion,"Dec. 01, 2022, 6:01 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Letters to the editor | The OregonianJuliana James’ letter makes some good points for an idyllic world, (“Readers respond: Sanctioned camps a start,” Nov. 25). She and many others advocate for these wonderful camps with physical and mental health services for people who are homeless.However, everything breaks down when she mentions rules for “no drugs, no weapons and no aggression.” The no-drugs requirement is precisely why the city’s “campers” do not choose to go to available shelters now. They are addicts and don’t want available rehab either. It’s also dreaming to think that weapons and aggression will not be allowed. They aren’t allowed in prisons either, but somehow manage to be fashioned for aggressive encounters.What about the hundreds of “campers” who would choose to not take advantage of these wonderful camp sites because of the rules?

"Oregon Measure 114 delay would lead to ‘unnecessary deaths,’ attorney general argues",Maxine Bernstein,Public Safety,"Dec. 01, 2022, 6:26 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 4:12 p.m.",125,"The Oregon Firearms Federation’s suit was the first court challenge to the state's new voter-approved gun control measure. A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday by the Second Amendment Foundation, Firearms Policy Coalition, two firearms dealers and one gun owner.Getty ImagesNEW!125sharesBy Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveOregon’s attorney general argued in court papers Wednesday that any court-ordered delay of gun control Measure 114 would result in more unnecessary deaths and forestall steps “to reduce the risk of a massacre” in the state.The recent voter-approved measure, set to take effect Dec. 8, will ban the sale, transfer or manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, require a permit to purchase a gun and only allow a gun to be sold or transferred once a criminal background check is completed.The new regulations, narrowly approved by 50.7% of voters, are designed to reduce mass shootings, suicides and homicides.The Oregon Firearms Federation, joined by three county sheriffs and two gun store owners in Keizer and Pendleton, last week filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction to bar Measure 114 from becoming law, arguing its requirements violate their Second Amendment right to bear arms, as well as their due process rights.The federation’s suit was the first court challenge to Oregon’s new gun control measure. A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday by the Second Amendment Foundation, Firearms Policy Coalition, two firearms dealers and one gun owner.U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut has scheduled a hearing at 10 a.m. Friday on the firearms federation’s emergency motion, six days before the measure is scheduled to go into effect.The gun owners and three sheriffs have argued that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are commonly used for self-defense, and without them, law-abiding gun owners will be at a tactical disadvantage when confronting criminals.The attorney general’s office, in its response, argued large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are not “arms” protected by the Second Amendment and the state’s new requirement for a permit to purchase a gun will withstand constitutional scrutiny.In a 42-page court filing Wednesday, a senior assistant attorney general wrote that any move to put the measure on hold while litigation proceeds would likely result in a rush of people buying “tens of thousands” of more guns and ammunition before the regulations could take hold and endanger public safety.A stampede to buy guns has already occurred.Before Nov. 8, the state police averaged 849 background check requests a day for new gun purchases. Since then, the daily average has quadrupled to 4,092, the attorney general’s filing says.The attorney general’s office argues that the current gun owners who have filed a lawsuit challenging the measure won’t be harmed if the measure becomes law.“Plaintiffs can continue to keep and bear the arms they currently possess, which is enough to protect their Second Amendment rights for the pendency of this litigation,” wrote Brian Simmonds Marshall, a senior assistant attorney general.The legal landscape has changed since the measure was drafted.In June, the U.S. Supreme Court set a new legal standard for evaluating Second Amendment claims. In a 6-3 ruling in June, the nation’s high court struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. The court’s majority directed lower courts to use a new “text-and-history” standard when evaluating challenges to firearms regulations.Courts must determine whether “the Second Amendment’s plain text” protects the conduct in which the plaintiff wishes to engage, and if it does, then decide if the regulation “is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”The firearms federation and other plaintiffs challenging the measure say that restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines are not part of any “historic tradition.”They further argue that the magazine capacity restriction amounts to the “physical taking of property without compensation,” and is therefore unconstitutional.A nonprofit called the Silent Majority Foundation, which advocates for individual liberty and wants to serve as a friend of the court in support of the firearms federation’s legal challenge, argued in a new legal filing Wednesday that magazines of more than ten rounds “are older than the United States.”“The first American presence of such firearms occurred, fittingly in Oregon, with a firearm that included a twenty-two round magazine as Meriwether Lewis carried a Girandoni air rifle on his famous expedition with William Clark and the Corps of Discovery in 1804-06,” its filing said.The attorney general’s office is confident the restrictions on large-capacity magazines will withstand the new standard set by the U.S. Supreme Court in the New York case.“Large-capacity magazines are also analogous to dangerous weapons that have historically been restricted without infringing on the core right of self-defense,” Marshall wrote.He noted that 12 other states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws restricting large-capacity magazines.Further, the office argues, there’s no historical precedent to compare to today’s gun violence epidemic.Mass shootings by a single individual that resulted in 10 or more deaths were unknown in U.S. history until 1949 and rare until 2007, according to the filing by the attorney general’s office.“Every mass shooting since 2004 that resulted in 14 or more deaths involved large-capacity magazines. The use of large-capacity magazines to perpetrate mass shootings has no precedent in the founding or reconstruction eras,” Marshall wrote. The social concern of massacres perpetrated by single shooters has no precedent in 1791 or even in 1868.”Ryan Busse, a former senior executive in the firearms industry who is now senior advisor to Giffords, the gun safety organization led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, filed a brief with the court in support of the Oregon attorney general’s stance. He also wrote a book called, “Gunfight: My Battle Against the Industry that Radicalized America.”He wrote that large-capacity magazines “are not necessary for the basic intended use of firearms. Further, in my experience large-capacity magazines are not necessary to effectively deploy guns for self-defense or sporting purposes like hunting.’’ He also said that most handguns and AR-15 style rifles can accept and fully function with a magazine that holds 10 or fewer rounds.The attorney general’s office also challenged the plaintiffs’ allegations that the measure violates their due process rights.People who already own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds can retain them and continue to keep and use them as long as they do so on their property or for sport shooting, shooting competitions or hunting, within the law’s restrictions.Measure 114 does not retroactively prohibit the possession of lawfully acquired large-capacity magazines, the attorney general’s office noted.“The law does not punish past purchases, only future conduct,” Marshall wrote. “Legislation readjusting rights and burdens of such ownership is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations.’’The attorney general’s office also defended the permit-to-purchase gun program. It contends the nation’s high court ruling in the New York case “expressly allows states” to adopt programs in which applicants are required to undergo a background check, pass a firearms safety course, and undergo fingerprinting before getting a license or permit, as required under Measure 114.“None of the Plaintiffs have applied for a permit. Nor have Plaintiffs offered any reason to think that one or more of them would be denied a permit under Measure 114 in violation of the Second Amendment. And if they were denied a permit, or one was not approved after 30 days, they could seek speedy review in the Oregon courts,” Marshall wrote.The attorney general’s office did not address what steps the state police or local law enforcement are taking to put a permit-to-purchase program in place by Dec. 8. Several county sheriffs in the state have vowed not to enforce the measure’s magazine restrictions.Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner, president of the Oregon Association of Chiefs of Police, said the association invited chiefs to a Zoom meeting on Nov. 22 to discuss what’s needed for local police agencies to process applications to buy guns. The measure says local law enforcement would handle applications, and it’s unclear whether county sheriffs or local police would take that role, he said.“This is new for us,” he said. “Unfortunately, in this case, we have more questions unanswered and a lot of unknowns.” The association has forwarded its questions to the Oregon Department of Justice to try to get some guidance and clarity, he said.Questions regarding whether Oregon State Police has created a uniform permit application and what would constitute law enforcement-approved firearms training that someone applying for a permit would be required to complete remain unanswered, he said.Typically, the chiefs or sheriffs are consulted by lawmakers who consider public safety-related legislation, Skinner said. With the voter-approved measure, “we were not consulted at all to answer these questions on the front end. It’s a little frustrating.”The second legal challenge filed Wednesday came from the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation, the Firearms Policy Coalition, a Clackamas County gun owner and two gun dealers from Douglas County and Washington County. It largely challenges the measure’s restrictions on large-capacity magazines and seeks a similar court-ordered injunction.Their complaint argues that many of the most popular handguns and rifles are made with magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.They allege that the measure’s restrictions will not accomplish what its proponents want it to do."" All it will do is leave law-abiding citizens more vulnerable to attack from better-armed and more ruthless assailants,” attorney James L. Buchal wrote, on behalf of the Second Amendment Foundation and its fellow plaintiffs. “Given the hundreds of millions of magazines in circulation in the country (including in Oregon, where they remain widely possessed), it will not be difficult for violent criminals to acquire them through illegal sales or importation despite Oregon’s ban.’’-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

"Oregon Measure 114 draws third legal suit, latest from NRA, National Shooting Sports Foundation",Maxine Bernstein,Public Safety,"Dec. 01, 2022, 11:37 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 3:26 p.m.",621,"The latest suit blasts the state for trying to impose a new permit application process to buy a gun before the details for an application process are in place and amid lingering questions regarding what agencies will accept applications and what funding and staffing is needed to support the program.AFP via Getty ImagesNEW!621sharesBy Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe National Rifle Association’s Oregon affiliate, joined by two former state lawmakers, an Oregon sporting goods store and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Thursday filed the third lawsuit challenging Measure 114, a day before a judge hears arguments on whether to delay the gun control measure from taking effect.The suit contends the measure imposes “severe and unprecedented burdens” on people seeking to lawfully acquire a gun under the Second Amendment and bans what it says have become standard magazines of ammunition.The measure, narrowly passed by 50.7% of voters, is set to take effect next Thursday. It will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that contain more than 10 rounds, require a permit to buy a gun and prevent any gun sale or transfer before a criminal background check is completed.The latest suit blasts the state for trying to impose a new permit application process to buy a gun before all the details for an application process are in place and amid lingering questions about what agencies will accept the applications and what funding and staffing are needed to support the program.It also echoes the prior lawsuits, which argue the measure violates the right to due process and the Second Amendment right to bear arms.“One might think that a state bent on imposing such a novel and burdensome permitting regime would at least take the time to make sure it had the infrastructure and resources in place to ensure that it would operate as smoothly as possible,” attorney Shawn M. Lindsay wrote on behalf of the plaintiffs.Lindsay, a Lake Oswego-based lawyer, filed the new lawsuit, but he’s expected to have help from two of the lawyers responsible for the major gun rights victory in June before the U.S. Supreme Court that set a new legal standard for evaluating Second Amendment claims. Attorneys Paul D. Clement, a former U.S. Solicitor General, and Erin E. Murphy, will be applying to practice in Oregon’s district court, the new suit says. They argued the case before the nation’s high court, which in a 6-3 ruling struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home.In a statement Thursday, Aoibheann Cline, the NRA’s Oregon director, said Measure 114 is “nothing more than an attempt to stifle - if not outright prevent - the purchase of firearms throughout Oregon.”“Forget that it is scheduled to go into effect before Oregon even certifies the election, but it requires potential gun owners to take a class that has yet to be created, at a cost yet to be determined, so that they can obtain a permit that doesn’t actually give them permission to purchase a firearm,” Cline said.Oregon’s attorney general has defended the measure and will be in court Friday morning to urge U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut to deny the Oregon Firearms Foundation’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.The firearms federation was the first to file a legal challenge last week. On Wednesday, the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation followed with its own suit. All the lawsuits are anticipated to be assigned to Immergut.Joining the NRA affiliate, the Oregon State Shooting Association, in this latest suit are Mazama Sporting Goods in Eugene, former state Rep. Katerina B. Eyre, R-Hillsboro, former state Rep. Tim Freeman, R-Roseburg, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.If no permit process is in place by next Thursday, they contend gun sales will cease on that day.Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall has argued in court papers that any delay in the new regulations would result in more deaths and deter the state from trying “to reduce the risk of a massacre” in Oregon.The Oregon Department of Justice has said it is working with state police to assist the agency in drafting rules for the new regulations and permit-to-purchase process. State police Capt. Kyle Kennedy said Thursday afternoon that the state police will provide information related to Measure 114 “as pieces are finalized.” The state police are finalizing an application form for permits and evaluating its future staffing needs, Kennedy said.The new regulations are designed to reduce mass shootings, suicides and homicides, the proponents have said. In 2020, 593 Oregonians died by gunfire, according to the attorney general’s office.Marshall quoted from a study by Alexander D. McCourt, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who found that permit-to-purchase gun laws, coupled with comprehensive background check requirements “were consistently associated with” lower firearm homicide and suicide rates.The new regulations also won’t harm gun owners, Marshall argued in court papers. People who already own magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds can retain them in their homes and still use them as long as they do so on their property or for sport shooting, shooting competitions or hunting, within state law, he noted.If the regulations are delayed, more people will continue to rush out and buy more guns and magazines, Marshall argued.After a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against California’s ban on large-capacity magazines in March 2019, he cited reports that large-capacity magazines poured into California’s gun stores. A judge later allowed the California ban to take effect, and the following week, a 19-year-old man bought a rifle and several 10-round gun magazines from a San Diego gun store. On April 27, 2019, the 19-year-old entered a Chabad synagogue in Poway, Calif., wearing a tactical vest that held five 10-round magazines and his rifle loaded with another 10-round magazine. He fired all 10 rounds of the loaded rifle magazine, killing one congregant and injuring three others, according to news reports cited by Marshall in his filing.“Before the gunman could reload with one of his five other magazines , an unarmed congregant rushed at him, forcing him to retreat to his car,” Marshall wrote, adding that gave time for an armed off-duty officer to intervene and fire back. The gunman then fled by car and surrendered.Gun rights advocates, including the plaintiffs in the latest suit, counter that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are standard today, and the measure would turn “law-abiding citizens into criminals” by making it a misdemeanor crime to carry or use the larger-capacity magazines outside of a shooting range, private property or for competition or hunting.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

"Hawaii volcano Mauna Loa spews toxic gases, molten lava: What are the risks on the Big Island?",The Associated Press,Environment,,"Nov. 29, 2022, 12:39 p.m.",0,"People watch the glow from lava erupting from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano, Monday, Nov. 28, 2022 in Hilo, Hawaii. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones)APNEW!By The Associated PressLava is shooting 100 feet to 200 feet into the air as Hawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupts for the first time in nearly 40 years.For now, lava is not threatening any homes or communities and no evacuation orders have been issued. Lava could eventually reach neighborhoods as it flows downhill though it could take a week or more for molten rock to reach populated areas.Mauna Loa is spewing sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases. They form volcanic smog, or vog, when they mix with vapor, oxygen and dust in sunlight. As a result, state health officials are urging people to cut back on outdoor exercise and other activities that cause heavy breathing.Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Its smaller, more active neighbor, Kilauea volcano, has been erupting continuously for more than a year since September 2021.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA?Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest (that title goes to Mauna Kea) but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass.It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean.Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. The current eruption is its 34th since written history began in 1843.The Big Island is mostly rural and hosts cattle ranches and coffee farms but it is also home to a few small cities, including the county seat of Hilo, which has a population of 45,000.It’s about 200 miles south of Hawaii’s most populous island, Oahu, where the state capital, Honolulu, and beach resort Waikiki are both located.Mauna Loa’s volume is estimated to be at least 18,000 cubic miles, making it the world’s largest volcano when measured from the ocean floor to its summit.IS MAUNA LOA EXPLODING LIKE MOUNT ST. HELENS?Mauna Loa is not exploding like Washington state’s Mount St. Helens did in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles (400 kilometers) away.The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa’s magma tends to be hotter, drier and more fluid. That allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is a shield volcano, named because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA ERUPTING FROM?The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks. Hon expects the current eruption to follow this pattern.The ground is shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating that it could erupt. Scientists say they don't expect that to happen right away but officials on the Big Island of Hawaii are telling residents to be prepared in case it does erupt soon. This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island.APWHAT HAZARDS ARE POSED BY MAUNA LOA’S ERUPTION?-Lava: Molten rock could cover houses, farms or neighborhoods, depending on where it flows. But lava from the northeast rift zone will likely take at least a week to reach populated areas, allowing people time to evacuate if needed.-Volcanic gas: Mauna Loa is releasing volcanic gases, mostly sulfur dioxide. The gases are present in their highest concentrations in the immediate area around the summit crater or vents. But they also combine with other particles to form vog, which can spread across the Big Island and even waft over to the state’s other islands.Vog can give healthy people burning eyes, headaches and sore throats. It can send those with asthma or other respiratory problems to the hospital.-Glass particles: When hot lava erupts from a fissure and rapidly cools, it forms glass particles named “Pele’s hair” and “Pele’s tears” after the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.The particles tend not to travel far from volcanic vents — maybe only a few hundred yards or a mile — and won’t threaten many people, said Aaron Pietruszka, an associate specialist at the University of Hawaii’s Department of Earth Sciences.“It just literally looks like hair strands. And that’s where the fluid lava is stretched by the wind to make long, thin strands,” said Pietruszka.The glass bits — as short as a few millimeters or as long as a few inches — can be sharp.“You wouldn’t want to be digging your hands in it because you could get a cut,” Pietruszka said.An N95 or KF94 mask would protect against these glass particles but not against volcanic gas, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health.“Pele’s hair” specimens from Kilauea volcano’s eruption are visible at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE MAUNA LOA’S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS?Mauna Loa released about 15,000 tons of carbon dioxide per day during its 1984 eruption, according to USGS data.That’s equivalent to the annual emissions from 2,400 sport utility vehicles.Scientists say all of Earth’s volcanoes combined emit less than one percent of the carbon dioxide that humans produce each year.If you purchase a product or register for an account through

"The list ranking the most on-time, reliable airlines, according to federal data",Nerd Wallet,Business,"Dec. 01, 2022, 10:55 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 7:28 a.m.",0,"Travelers wait for boarding to begin in LaGuardia Airport's Terminal B, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2022, in New York. Travel experts say the ability of many people to work remotely is letting them take off early for Thanksgiving or return home later. Crowds are expected to rival those of 2019, the last Thanksgiving before the pandemic. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)APNEW!By Nerd WalletWhen booking a flight, you want the option that will get you and your stuff where you want to go — preferably on time. Unfortunately, that’s not been a given recently.Airline performance has struggled over the past year as passengers flock back to the skies. According to Transportation Security Administration screening data, almost 11 million more passengers traveled in June 2022 compared with June 2021.To see which airlines handled these turbulent times best, NerdWallet dug into data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to analyze the on-time percentage, cancellation rate, flight diversions, mishandled baggage, tarmac delays and involuntary denied boardings to determine the most reliable airlines in the U.S. for 2022.For an airline to be eligible for our analysis, it had to be based in the U.S. and have a publicly available rewards search calendar with availability from 15 days to eight months from the time of search.We used percentages and rates to avoid penalizing airlines with larger operations. For example, Delta Air Lines may have had more cancellations than the smaller Frontier, but as a percentage of all operated flights, Frontier had a higher cancellation rate.Here’s a breakdown of the winners and losers in each category.On-time percentageAn airline’s on-time percentage is perhaps the most important statistic for showing how well an airline performs. After all, this is a factor that affects every passenger on the plane.The Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracked the percentage of flights that arrive at the destination gate less than 15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time, which it considers “on-time.”Based on BTS data from July 2021 to June 2022, two airlines topped an 80% on-time percentage. Hawaiian Airlines took the top prize with 86%. Delta Air Lines landed just behind Hawaiian with an 84% on-time percentage.The worst performers were JetBlue Airways — with 65% of flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time — and Frontier Airlines, with a 69% on-time percentage. That means more than 1 of every 3 JetBlue flights was delayed by more than 15 minutes during this period.Flight cancellationsWhile a delayed flight is bad, a canceled flight can cause much more havoc to travel plans.Flight cancellations require rebooking on a new flight and could potentially mean dealing with buying overpriced airport food or finding last-minute overnight lodging.BTS data from July 2021 to June 2022 shows Hawaiian performed best of all U.S. airlines with just a 0.81% cancellation rate. Delta took second place again — with a cancellation rate of 1.63%. Meanwhile, merger partners JetBlue (3.81%) and Spirit Airlines (4.11%) canceled the highest percentage of all flights.Note that the flight cancellation data includes flights that are canceled seven days or less before departure only. That means this metric doesn’t penalize airlines that reschedule or cancel flights more than a week ahead of departure.Mishandled luggageDo you check or carry on your bags? If you’re Team Carry-On, you might not care how often airlines lose travelers’ bags. But how well an airline handles luggage is an important factor for those who want to travel with full-size toiletries or who don’t want to lug their luggage through the airport.Yet again, Hawaiian took top marks from July 2021 to June 2022 with 0.28% of checked bags mishandled according to BTS data. Put another way, around 1 of every 357 bags checked on Hawaiian Airlines were lost, delayed or mishandled. Frontier (0.36%) and Southwest Airlines (0.43%) round out the podium on the mishandled bags metric.Oneworld alliance partners American Airlines (0.84%) and Alaska Airlines (0.70%) were the worst-performing airlines for mishandled luggage during the period analyzed. American also mishandled the most number of checked bags in the same time period: 897,345.Flight diversionsPerhaps even worse than a canceled flight is when a flight is diverted to an airport other than the destination airport. And unfortunately, this isn’t as rare as you might think. Across the largest U.S. airlines, around 0.24% of flights were diverted from July 2021 to June 2022. That’s around 1 in every 416 scheduled flights.BTS data for the same period shows that Hawaiian diverted 62 flights — for a diversion rate of 0.08% — or 1 of every 1,165 scheduled flights. Frontier took second place at 0.15%. Meanwhile, JetBlue was the worst performer with 1,091 diverted flights during this period for a diversion rate of 0.43% — or 1 of every 232 scheduled flights.Other performance metricsTo round out our analysis, we also looked at the number of tarmac delays and involuntary denied boardings.Airlines must report when a flight has a “tarmac delay” of over three hours for a domestic flight and over four hours on an international flight. From July 2021 to June 2022, Hawaiian was the only major U.S. airline to avoid having a single tarmac delay. Meanwhile, Delta had 92 tarmac delays — including one delay of nearly seven hours.An involuntary denied boarding happens when an airline oversells a flight and doesn’t get enough volunteers to take a later flight. Hawaiian didn’t record a single involuntary denied boarding for the period analyzed. On the other end, Frontier denied boarding to 5,657 flyers, while American did the same to 7,912 passengers.The most reliable airline of 2022Hawaiian Airlines performed the best in every metric we checked — from on-time percentage to involuntary denied boardings. That makes Hawaiian Airlines our most reliable airline for 2022 in a landslide.Delta takes second place overall with a No. 2 finish in half of the performance metrics. Alaska finishes in third place due to a strong on-time percentage and low cancellation rate.JetBlue’s performance was the worst of any U.S. airline, with a bottom-three finish in almost all metrics. Based on our weightings, Spirit finishes in second-to-last place, with American and Frontier tying for the third-worst-performing airline.MethodologyFor this analysis, we looked at several types of operations data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that captured performance of U.S. airlines from July 2021 to July 2022.Here is our full dataset for determining the most reliable airlines in 2022.

Portland brothers charged with 2021 murder of Vancouver teen  ,Zane Sparling,Public Safety,"Dec. 02, 2022, 11:06 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 9:33 a.m.",0,"7Sergio Hunt Jr., 17, found dead in Northeast PortlandNEW!By Zane Sparling | The Oregonian/OregonLiveTwo brothers have been charged with murder after one of them allegedly shot and killed a Vancouver teenager who was driving the trio around in a stolen sedan, the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.Omarion N. Pervish, 18, is charged with first-degree murder after he allegedly shot the driver, Sergio Hunt, then dumped the dying 17-year-old onto Northeast Milton Street in Portland near 143rd Avenue and ran over him with an Audi they allegedly stole late in the evening of May 22, 2021.Keyshawn T. Pervish, 21, is charged with second-degree murder for his alleged role in the plot.Both brothers were arraigned Wednesday, and the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office released a detailed description of the alleged robbery gone wrong.Neighbors found Hunt, a former varsity basketball player, lying in a pool of blood, stripped of shoes and most of his clothes early the next morning, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported at the time.“My baby had a big personality, a contagious smile and was a phenomenal basketball player,” his mother Andrea Warren said.After the shooting, the brothers allegedly crashed the Audi into a nearby vehicle, leaving behind the Audi’s emblem — which became an early clue seized upon by investigators, according to the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office.Omarion Pervish, whose listed address is a North Portland home, was arrested Nov. 22 inside a stolen RAV4 SUV that had been reported by a neighbor who thought it was associated with a recent home burglary, according to court documents. Omarion Pervish was previously convicted of possessing a stolen car in Washington in 2021.Keyshawn Pervish was homeless at the time of his arrest Tuesday, booking records show.He has open cases for allegedly being caught in a stolen car in September in Portland and allegedly committing third-degree robbery last December in Clackamas County. He was charged with second-degree assault after he allegedly knocked out a woman’s tooth and blackened her eye in November 2021.Both brothers are also charged with first-degree robbery, unlawful use of a vehicle and possession of a stolen vehicle.— Zane Sparling; zsparling@oregonian.com; 503-319-7083; @pdxzaneOur journalism needs your support.

"Oregon women’s basketball focused on defense, closing out games ahead of matchup with Portland",James Crepea,Ducks,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 9:14 a.m.",0,"NEW!By James Crepea | The Oregonian/OregonLiveAfter splitting its trip at the PKI, Oregon got to spend the better part of a week focusing on improving defensively and finishing games.The No. 19 Ducks (5-1) held leads against both North Carolina and Michigan State and couldn’t hold off the Tar Heels but closed out the Spartans. They hope to show a more consistent effort through all 40 minutes of this afternoon’s game (2 p.m., Pac-12 Network) against the Pilots (5-3) at Matthew Knight Arena.“That (North Carolina) game was super fun; it was a test for us to play a top 10 team,” guard Te-Hina Paopao said. “I was pretty pleased with how we played but our second half effort, it could have been better and I think that’s why we lost. ... (We learned) don’t get too comfortable when you have a great lead. We get too comfortable and then we allow teams to come back and work harder than us. That’s going to be our mindset, play all 40 minutes as hard as we can.”Paopao is second nationally with a 7.7 assist-to-turnover ratio and a big reason why Oregon ranks eighth nationally in that stat.Ducks coach Kelly Graves is pleased with his team’s efficiency and ball movement and wants to see more scoring from Paopao (13.8 points) and Endyia Rogers (12.0 ppg.).“I think our guards are being a little too unselfish,” Graves said. “I think they’re passing up that little floater, the little pull-up in the paint out of pick-and-roll action. We continue to encourage them to take that shot when it’s there. Offensively I have no issues right now. It’s at the defensive end we got to be a little bit better.”Oregon has been winning the rebounding battle but second-chance points allowed is an area Graves wants to improve. Defensive rotations have also been problematic, though somewhat expected with three freshmen playing significant roles.Those will be areas of importance against Portland, which had point guard Haylee Andrews back in the lineup and former Duck Lucy Cochrane at center. The 6-foot-6 Cochrane (6.1 ppg., 5.9 rpg.) will be a comparable matchup in size for Oregon’s Phillipina Kyei (10-2. ppg., 9.8 rpg.), who is coming off 15 points and 16 rebounds against Michigan State.“She left a couple of baskets out there; I reminded her of that (Wednesday),” Graves said. “But I was most impressed with the fact that she played 30 quality minutes, didn’t seem to be tired or anything like that.“We love Lucy. I think she just realized that with that one class that was coming in it may a little tough for her but she’s had a nice career at Portland. It’ll be a good match; she’s got great timing inside. Philli I think is stronger and a little bit bigger, but Lucy is going to be a formidable foe for her.”If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",158,"'-1':34 '-12':77 '-2':388 '-3':83 '-6':369 '10':105,387 '12.0':235 '13.8':230 '15':396 '16':399 '19':31 '2':74 '30':431 '40':67,178 '5':33,82 '5.9':373 '6':367 '6.1':371 '7.7':191 '9.8':390 'account':519 'action':272 'afternoon':71 'allow':159,319 'also':330 'andrew':354 'anyth':441 'area':322,344 'arena':87 'assist':193 'assist-to-turnov':192 'back':163,355 'ball':220 'basket':409 'battl':313 'better':18,130,306 'big':199 'bigger':498 'bit':305,497 'career':474 'carolina':40,90 'center':365 'chanc':317 'class':456 'close':53 'coach':209 'cochran':363,370 'come':162,394,459 'comfort':145,155 'compar':378 'compens':531 'consist':63 'continu':274 'could':127 'couldn':45 'coupl':407 'crepea':4 'defens':26,297,327 'didn':434 'duck':32,361 'effici':218 'effort':64,125 'eighth':204 'encourag':276 'end':298 'endyia':233 'expect':335 'fact':427 'finish':28 'floater':257 'focus':23 'foe':507 'foot':368 'former':360 'formid':506 'freshmen':338 'fun':94 'game':73,91 'games.the':29 'get':143,153 'go':171,502 'good':481 'got':14,300,485 'grave':211,247,323,418 'great':150,486 'guard':107,240,352 'half':124 'hard':181 'harder':166 'hayle':353 'heel':51 'held':35 'hina':110 'hold':47 'hope':58 'import':346 'impress':424 'improv':25,326 'insid':488 'issu':290 'jame':3 'kelli':210 'knight':86 'kyei':386 'lead':36,151 'learn':140 'left':405 'like':442 'lineup':358 'link':524 'littl':244,256,259,304,464,496 'll':478 'lost':138 'love':445 'luci':362,446,500 'match':482 'matchup':379 'matthew':85 'may':462,529 'michigan':42,402 'mindset':175 'minut':68,179,433 'movement':221 'nation':188,205 'network':78 'new':1 'nice':473 'north':39,89 'offens':286 'one':455,521 'oregon':13,202,307,383 'oregonian/oregonliveafter':6 'p.m':75 'pac':76 'paint':265 'paopao':111,185,229 'part':19 'pass':253 'philli':489 'phillipina':385 'pick':269 'pick-and-rol':268 'pilot':81 'pki':12 'play':102,120,176,339,430 'pleas':116,213 'point':231,318,351,397 'portland':348,476 'ppg':236,372,389 'pretti':115 'problemat':332 'product':514 'pull':261 'pull-up':260 'purchas':512 'qualiti':432 'rank':203 'ratio':196 're':252 'realiz':451 'reason':200 'rebound':312,400 'receiv':530 'regist':516 'remind':413 'right':291 'roger':234 'roles.those':341 'roll':271 'rotat':328 'rpg':374,391 'said':112,248,419 'score':227 'second':123,187,316 'second-ch':315 'see':225 'seem':436 'shot':281 'show':60 'signific':340 'site':527 'size':381 'somewhat':334 'spartan':56 'spend':16 'split':7 'stat.ducks':208 'state':43,403 'stronger':493 'super':93 'take':279 'tar':50 'te':109 'te-hina':108 'team':106,160,216 'test':98 'think':133,238,250,448,491 'though':333 'three':337 'time':487 'tire':439 'top':104 'tough':465 'trip':9 'turnov':195 'unselfish':246 'us':100,168 'want':223,324 'wednesday':417 'week':22 'win':310 'work':165","{""The Oregonian""}"
"Regular tutoring can help students catch up post-pandemic, but it’s slow to roll out in Oregon",Julia Silverman,Education,"Nov. 23, 2022, 12:31 p.m.","Nov. 23, 2022, 8:03 a.m.",0,"Dominic Villanueva, a second grader at Durham Elementary in Tigard, works one-on-one with his virtual reading tutor.Julia Silverman | The Oregonian/OregonLiveNEW!By Julia Silverman | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIn the furious effort to help students catch up in reading and math after two-plus years of pandemic upheaval, states around the country are zeroing in on a particular strategy: frequent, individualized tutoring.But not Oregon.The state’s 197 school districts have $1.1 billion in federal pandemic aid to spend as they see fit by 2024.So far, only 8% of districts have told the state Department of Education that they are earmarking some of it for so-called “high-dosage” tutoring, despite an emerging consensus among education researchers that it’s one of the most effective ways to help struggling students catch up.Key elements of the high-dose variety are that it takes place one-on-one or in groups of no more than three, during the school day, multiple times per week, with the same adult. If done right, researchers say, it can bring students up an entire grade level within a single school year.High-quality tutoring like this is expensive and potentially difficult to staff and sustain. Teachers and administrators need to monitor student progress, and—ideally—carve out time for tutoring within the school day. Companies offering virtual tutoring services have flooded into the market in the past few years, and districts need to figure out which if any are worth the money.To combat the difficulty of getting tutoring programs up and running, a number of states — including Tennessee, New Jersey, Texas and Illinois — have launched concerted efforts to help districts navigate the tutoring landscape, including creating databases of recommended virtual tutoring providers and connecting districts with a network of in-person tutors from local universities and volunteer programs.Oregon, by contrast, has isolated efforts in the planning stages in a handful of school districts and pilot programs getting off the ground in others.“Districts are best positioned to understand their student and community needs,” said Marc Siegel, spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Education. “[Federal pandemic relief] funds empower districts to tailor their efforts to these local needs.”Maya Erdman and her classmates at Durham Elementary in Tigard participate in a virtual tutoring session focused on reading.Julia Silverman | The Oregonian/OregonLivePATIENT, PHONICS-BASED HELPAt 12:11 pm every weekday, the bright, open atrium at the center of Durham Elementary in Tigard is quiet and empty, with most students off at recess or lunch. Two minutes later, the chattering of 16 second graders bounces off the rafters, as students race in, grab their seats, find an iPad, slip on a giant pair of headphones and greet their reading tutors, who are beaming in from around the country.All 16 read below grade level, but that doesn’t mean they all need the same help. Some are still working on sounding out individual letters (“Zz for zebra”), some are on compound blends (“Ch for chap or chat”), some can “partner read” a simple paragraph, taking turns with their tutor, sentence by sentence.The urgent goal: Get them to grade level by the end of the year. Decades of research shows that if students can’t read independently by third grade, they’re at much greater risk of falling behind, and ultimately, dropping out.Durham serves a greater concentration of students navigating poverty than most of Tigard-Tualatin’s nine other elementaries, which is part of why district officials chose it to pilot the high-dose help. All children taking part are in special education, eligible for free school meals or learning English as a second language.The chosen 16 see their tutors every school day for 15-minute sessions. The same grown-up, day in and day out, offers patient, phonics-based instruction. Though the program has only been in place since early October, Durham principal Cleann Brewer says most of the children have already shown measurable improvement.Sixty-three percent of them are reading six to 10 more grade-level words per minute than when tutoring started seven weeks ago, which Brewer says is “huge.”“Some of these kids didn’t do well online, so I was skeptical at first,” she says. “But they show up on time every day. They’re really disappointed if there is some kind of tutor issue. And they are engaged 100% of those minutes.”It doesn’t, however, come cheap. Tigard-Tualatin is spending $40,000 to pilot this program at Durham this year. If any of the initial participants improve enough to hit grade level, another child can have their seat.Across Oregon, just 15 districts have informed the state that they plan to spend a portion of their federal relief funds on high-dosage tutoring, Siegel says. That includes four of the state’s largest districts — Portland, Salem, Eugene and Medford — and some of its smallest, including the Annex School District in Malheur County, with just 61 students. (The rest are Culver, Dallas, Douglas County, Lincoln County, Malheur County, Mollala River, South Umpqua, Sutherlin and Three Rivers/Josephine County.)An additional 17 districts have told the state they are setting aside at least some of their federal money for tutoring but have yet to specify how many times a week it will be offered to students and for how long. Some districts could be offering high-dose tutoring using other funding sources that don’t require them to tell the state what they’re spending it on.BEYOND K-5In an ideal world, individualized instruction would be much more broadly available, even for students who are at grade level but could have been much further along if not for pandemic-related disruptions, says Andrew McEachin, a program director at Portland-based testing and research outfit NWEA.Still, the Durham program is well-designed, he says, starting with the fact that the tutoring is built into the school day. Brewer says she pushed for that, so she and others on her staff could pop in regularly to make sure everything was running smoothly and consistently. The second graders miss 15 minutes of math instruction, but their teachers go over what they’ve missed when they return, while their classmates are doing independent work.Holding tutoring before school ran the risk of kids oversleeping or busy caregivers not getting there in time, she says; after school, many kids peel off for other activities or are simply spent after the school day.Virtual tutoring programs like the Ignite! Reading one in use at Durham are gaining in popularity, particularly given a tight job market in the Portland area as well as in the more rural corners of the state, which have long struggled to hire and keep educators. A virtual program should include a live, trained tutor on the other side of the camera, McEachin says. Chat-based, self-paced-and-monitored programs can leave students disengaged and frustrated, he says.And while many districts are gearing their tutoring programs to younger students, McEachin points out that they have more years of schooling to get caught up, while middle and high schoolers’ window is closing more rapidly.Portland Public Schools has nearly $1.1 million in federal pandemic relief funds set aside for a high-dosage tutoring program. District officials say tutoring will begin to roll out in January at elementary and K-8 schools with the highest need for reading support. Tutoring for middle schoolers and high schoolers will follow later, they say.Portland’s programs will operate three days a week after school, with 30- to 45-minute in-person sessions led by district employees. Each tutor will be paired with no more than three students. Participation will be voluntary but highly encouraged, with outreach to families from teachers and administrators.Few other metro-area districts have told the state that they plan to spend federal pandemic relief funds on tutoring. The Reynolds School District, where test scores suggest that most children are below grade level, makes no mention of it in the budget document that they were required to file with the state. The Beaverton School District says it is spending federal relief dollars on half-time “academic coaches” at all of its elementary schools and full-time ones at its middle schools, at a cost of about $4.5 million a year. Their duties are split between professional development for teachers and individual help for students.Corbett, on the outskirts of Multnomah County, spent $30,000 to hire a math paraeducator who leads one-on-one math tutoring on Fridays, and $37,000 for a part-time language arts teacher who also tutors on Fridays.NO EASY SOLUTIONSSome parents are taking matters into their own hands. In Beaverton, Amanda Coen, whose children attend Raleigh Hills K-8, raised money for an after-school tutoring program there that is just getting up and running. It’s for 10 second and third graders who are struggling with reading and gives them an hour a week with an online one-on-one tutor. It also provides 15 minutes a day of reading games to do on a computer at home, with devices given to families in need.Her goal and hope, Coen says, is to expand the pilot into all of the district’s 32 elementary schools, but the price tag is substantial. It cost $35,000 just to get her phonics-based pilot into Raleigh Hills for this school year. But having seen her own daughter, now a middle schooler, struggle with literacy, she knew firsthand the desperation kids might be feeling.“My turning point was laying in bed with my daughter, and she was crying,” Coen recalled of a conversation a few years ago. “And she said, ‘I feel really dumb, because I don’t know when to turn the page. [So] I just wait until the person next to me turns the page, so I don’t look like I am falling behind, or reading slow.’ She wasn’t reading. She didn’t know how to read.”Tutoring is not a silver bullet, more like one arrow in a quiver. Schools nationwide are experimenting with multiple strategies to help with academic recovery. Doubling up on math instruction during the school day is one possibility. Extending the school day or school year is another, but requires reopening contract negotiations with teacher unions, which could prove contentious, particularly for a workforce that already feels both burnt out and under the gun. Summer school holds promise but needs family buy-in and careful design.The Biden administration, meanwhile, is placing a high-stakes bet on the power of tutoring, underwriting an ambitious plan to send 250,000 tutors into American schools over the next three years.Some education researchers say the effort should go even further. They’ve called for an all-hands-on-deck approach to tutoring. Send high-achieving high schoolers and community college students into the elementary schools to earn credits, they say, and college students into middle and high schools. Mobilize parent volunteers and retired teachers and call in Americorps, they say, given the dire results on national and state test scores.Such efforts sound wonderful in theory but would be logistically challenging, said Brewer, the principal in Tigard, given the effort of finding and training qualified tutors, and then making sure that they stick with the job.Virtual programs outsource that work, but districts need to make sure they are aligned with their core curriculum standards and capable of tracking and reporting student progress, McEachin said.Christine Pitts, the director of impact at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at Arizona State University and a former research and evaluation lead at Portland Public Schools, said the complex logistics of launching a successful tutoring program at the needed scale is precisely why districts need more specific direction from the state.“Teachers do tutoring. And there is small group instruction to address student learning needs. That’s happening. But in typical Oregon fashion, it’s patchwork,” Pitts said. “From one part of the state to another, you have people developing different initiatives here and there. It’s important for us to have local adaptations based on different challenges and communities. But when you have [all the] districts in the state doing all different things, it’s really hard for state leaders to point to successes across the state to say that we had big wins.”— Julia Silverman, jsilverman@oregonian.com, @jrlsilvermanOur journalism needs your support.

Portland Trail Blazers’ defensive regression continues: ‘We’ve had some slippage’,Aaron Fentress,Blazers,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:14 p.m.",0,"The Los Angeles Lakers' Anthony Davis (middle) goes hard to the basket against a host of Portland Trail Blazers defenders in the second quarter at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022, in Los Angeles. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times/TNS)TNSNEW!By Aaron Fentress | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe expected return of Trail Blazers’ guard Damian Lillard on Sunday will certainly give the team a boost, but unless the defense gets back on track the losses will likely continue to pile up.The Blazers, who play at 6 p.m. Saturday at Utah, have lost eight of their past 10 games, with Lillard missing the last six and the team losing five of those contests.But while Lillard’s impact on winning is undeniable — the Blazers (11-11) are 7-2 in games he starts and finishes — the collapse of the defense has become such a major issues that his return might not completely turn things around.“We’ve had some slippage on the defensive side,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said.To put it mildly.The Blazers have producing a defensive rating of 119.6 (29th in the NBA) across their last 10 games while allowing teams to score inside and outside with ease. The Blazers rank 26th in points allowed in the paint (54.2 per game) and 29th in defensive three-point percentage (39.1%).To place their recent defensive rating into perspective, the team’s rating last season was 117.9 and that included several months of blatant tanking with a young lineup.The Los Angeles Lakers, one of the worst three-point shooting teams in the NBA, hit on 37.8% during Wednesday night’s 128-109 victory over the Blazers at Crypto.com Arena.“It can be attributed to a lot of things,” Billups said. “We’re playing a lot of guys that are not used to playing. A lot of different lineups.”Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups gives direction as Portland faces the Los Angeles Clippers in an NBA game at Moda Center in Portland, Oregon on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022.Sean Meagher/The OregonianThe Blazers have been dealing with a lot of injuries, the latest being a hip fracture that will sideline Nassir Little for six weeks.But the team played strong defensively prior to this stretch with several key players missing games.For the most part, Billups said, the team is simply going through a loss of depth due to injuries that has created fatigue, which can lead to poor defense. Also, the Blazers simply aren’t playing well, especially physically.“You’ve got to play with a level of physicality every single night, to be a good defensive team,” Billups said. “We’ve taken a little step back with that.”Backup center Drew Eubanks said the team has been off, especially with communication, which was much better coming out of the preseason than it has been lately.“We just kind of lost our way a little bit with what was working,” Eubanks. “And it’s still early. We haven’t had time to practice. We’ve been on the road a bunch.”The constant lineup changes, he said, have contributed.“It’s just tough to get a rhythm like that,” Eubanks said.But the team hasn’t lost its spirit.“Nothing has changed,” Eubanks said. “We still have the pieces to do what we need to do.”Trendon Watford agreed.“We’re fine,” he said. “We know this won’t last forever. Once everybody gets healthy and everybody gets back on track, we’ll be alright. It’s still early.”-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook).

A U.S. judge in Texas on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2022, blocked Biden's plan to provide millions of borrowers with up to $20,000 apiece in federal student-loan forgiveness. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)APNEW!By Leada Gore | lgore@al.comThe Education Department is sending out emails to update applicants on student loan forgiveness, even as the proposal remains mired in court hearings.Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department began sending emails out Saturday and would continue to send the out to applicants in the coming days, The Hill reported. The emails are being sent to applicants whose forgiveness has been approved, pending court hearings.“We remain confident in our legal authority to carry out the Student Loan Debt Relief program @POTUS & I announced in August,” Cardona tweeted. “Borrowers, remember, we will not stop fighting for you.”We remain confident in our legal authority to carry out the Student Loan Debt Relief program @POTUS & I announced in August.

President Biden’s plan would forgive up to $20,000 in student loans for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for other federal borrowers. Originally, the Department of Education said applicants should apply by Nov. 15 for their information to be processed before payments were set to re-start Jan. 1, 2023.The federal website is no longer accepting applications, however.“Courts have issued orders blocking our student debt relief program. As a result, at this time, we are not accepting applications.

Rural Oregon town rejected a preschool for years. Now parents embrace its expansion,Rose Wong,Education,"Nov. 20, 2022, 4:36 p.m.","Nov. 20, 2022, 8:00 a.m.",0,"Children at the public preschool in Yoncalla, a rural town 45 miles south of Eugene, revel in playing with fall leaves. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)NEW!By Rose Wong | The Oregonian/OregonLiveDays before Halloween, children at Yoncalla Preschool gathered around a table displaying images of loved ones who had passed away, some shown in framed photos, some hand-drawn: Delanee’s grandma wearing a Santa hat, Brooklynn’s grandpa holding her on his lap, Jayah’s pug named Romeo.The class was celebrating Día de los Muertos, a Mexican holiday traditionally observed in early November to honor the dead.Every year, at least one preschooler in the rural small town loses a family member. Megan Barber, the preschool’s director and head teacher, needed a way to help the 3- and 4-year-olds talk about grief. Cut-out paper hearts that students had decorated leaned against images of lost loved ones, and purple yarn hung from each of the hearts. Barber explained to students that “a heartstring” connects them with their loved ones even after they die, the same string that connects them with their parents when they’re at school and “connects you with me when you’re home.”“We’re recognizing we can be sad but also move on and experience joy in life,” Barber said.In the preschool classroom next door, teacher Jill Wells introduced the day’s storytime book: “The Day of the Dead/El Día de los Muertos: A Bilingual Celebration.” Wells read the English pages while Flor Rivera, an instructional assistant from El Salvador, read the Spanish translation.The preschool, free for any 3- or 4-year old in the district, aims to help children develop confidence and emotional regulation, along with knowledge of letters, numbers and the water cycle. Teachers and parents say preschoolers who take part arrive at kindergarten primed for success.But the preschool’s existence was anything but a given 10 years ago, when Portland-area do-gooders proposed it – and the townsfolk balked.Located 45 miles south of Eugene, Yoncalla has just over 1,000 people and a square-mile of city proper. Most families who have lived in Yoncalla for generations have felt the punch of poverty and unemployment, dating back to at least 1990, when logging and mill jobs had dried up in much of rural Oregon. These days, many Yoncallans commute to larger nearby cities to work in manufacturing, retail or health care.The school district is the town’s biggest employer. But most teachers and administrators live 30 to 40 miles outside the town, while locals tend to work as substitute teachers and classroom assistants.In 2012, a Portland-based nonprofit, the Children’s Institute, tried to help the school district open a public preschool. The idea was simple: A child’s brain creates millions of synapses per second, completing 90% of its growth by age 5. Waiting until kindergarten to boost children’s brain power makes little sense. Extensive research has shown children who receive high-quality early education experience better social, health and economic outcomes later in life.Families in a low-income neighborhood in east Portland had embraced that idea, welcoming the Children’s Institute’s help to open a preschool at their local elementary school.But the child advocacy nonprofit soon realized that Yoncalla was too apprehensive about its school district to hand over their 3- and 4-year-olds four days a week.For years, families distrusted the district, which scorned community involvement, suffered from rampant teacher turnover and consistently produced poor student outcomes, parents told The Oregonian/OregonLive this fall.“School looked like a zoo,” said parent Trinity Akins, whose six children are or have been students in the district.When a child advocacy nonprofit first tried to start a free preschool at Yoncalla Elementary, they soon realized Yoncalla was too apprehensive about its school district to hand over their 3- and 4-year-olds four days a week. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)For a pre-kindergarten program to be successful, Children’s Institute leaders realized, public opinion had to change.“We have a lot of people that are really poor and come from families with complexities,” said Erin Helgren, principal of Yoncalla Elementary who is also on staff at the Children’s Institute. “They were treated poorly in school, and they didn’t have the expectations that their own child’s needs would be met.”Parents had also been let down by organizations or businesses that tried to introduce early education programs in Yoncalla that were short-lived or largely served families from surrounding towns.In response to families’ negative feedback about a preschool launch, organizers pivoted to building trust with Yoncalla families. District and Children’s Institute leaders organized regular kindergarten readiness workshops at the local library, inviting experts to discuss social-emotional learning, best practices for reading to children and other ways to prepare their little ones for kindergarten. They served dinners to families who took part.Organizers also welcomed families to share what they would like a community preschool to look like. Parents asked for bus transportation, slots for families who didn’t quite qualify as low-income and the ability to visit children during school hours. Sure thing, district leaders said.By 2015, after three years of community-building efforts, the district felt it had garnered enough support.Yoncalla Preschool opened that fall with 22 children, using a classroom off an atrium connected to the elementary school. Through its Preschool Promise program, the state paid for 19 slots. The school district, the Children’s Institute and southern Oregon-based Ford Family Foundation paid for three more to serve children from families who earned too much to qualify for Preschool Promise. The state program, launched six years ago, serves families earning up to twice the federal poverty rate.Barber visited incoming preschoolers’ homes before the start of the school year to get to know families and talk through their concerns. Those visits allowed children to build trust with Barber before the first day of school, which helped ease their transition into a new environment. Throughout the school year, she continued to encourage family involvement through class dinners, open houses and parent volunteer opportunities in their child’s classroom.While Yoncalla Preschool exposes children to math and reading, Barber said, its core mission is to help students arrive at elementary school equipped for learning. That means helping them develop self-confidence, self-discipline and skills for resolving conflict and regulating negative emotions.The one-room preschool became so popular that, four years later, a second classroom opened. The two classes now have 18 children each, led by a teacher and two instructional assistants.The district plans to add a third classroom to meet student demand, Barber said.Yoncalla parents today speak proudly of their local preschool. Samantha Short said pre-kindergarten gave her 7-year-old son, Jaxxon, a love for learning that has followed him into first grade.“He would jump and wave all the way onto the bus,” she said, “and when he couldn’t go to school because he was sick or had other stuff to do, his little heart would be completely broken.”Yoncalla Preschool exposes 3- and 4-year-olds to early literacy and math skills. But at its heart, it aims to instill confidence, emotional self-regulation and similar skills that help children thrive as learners in elementary school. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)Preschool also helped Jaxxon correct a speech impediment. As a preschooler, her son was often frustrated because people could not understand him, Short said. After Barber recommended Jaxxon be evaluated for a language delay, he started receiving small-group speech therapy several hours a week. As he became more easily understood by others, he became more confident. “You could just see something clicked for him,” Short said.Six of this year’s preschoolers are receiving speech therapy, while 11 others are being evaluated. Completing speech therapy in preschool allows students to enter kindergarten ready to learn, Barber said.The preschool uses HighScope, a play-based curriculum that promotes creativity and independence, and Conscious Discipline, a set of instructional materials and strategies for social-emotional learning.When conflict occurs, Barber rolls out the “Time Machine:” Two students stand on opposite ends of a long mat, moving towards the center as they complete each step of conflict resolution written on the mat. The teacher stands between the children to facilitate the dialogue, starting by asking “are you willing” to set aside ego and listen to the other person.“Our kids are having better coping skills than adults,” said Madison Kokos, mom of two children who have attended the preschool. “They are teaching us.”Ninety percent of Yoncalla kindergarteners come through the preschool. Elementary school teacher Carol Robins said students who attend the preschool typically learn faster and get along better with their peers than those who do not.“When kids from the preschool come to kindergarten,” she said, “they are ready to learn.”Short’s 7- and 5-year-olds both attended Yoncalla Preschool. Her youngest, 3-year-old Bobbi, watched her older brother and sister ride off on the yellow school bus and come home with crafts they made. The siblings would show off new songs or a breathing exercise they learned.Bobbi starts preschool next year but she cannot seem to wait until then.“She asks me everyday,” Short said, “when is it my turn to go to school?”-- Rose Wong covers early childhood education for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Though tribes ceded lands in the scenic area as part of their treaties with the U.S. government, tribal members retain the rights to fish and gather roots and berries and continue to have a strong link with the river.Miller has served as commissioner since her appointment by Gov. Kate Brown in 2019. She is currently one of three tribal members serving on the 13-member commission. The others are commission vice-chair Pah-tu Pitt, also a Warm Springs member, and commissioner Jerry Meninick, a Yakama Nation elder. Both were appointed by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.That’s a significant rise in tribal representation for a commission that has had just a handful of Indigenous commissioners. Louie Pitt, Pah-tu Pitt’s father, was the first Indigenous person appointed to the commission in 1993. A total of five Indigenous leaders have served on the commission.Miller said her appointment as chair is significant because “the state of Oregon has had a history of not fully supporting tribal sovereignty or always being a good political ally.”The commission, established in 1987 by the states of Oregon and Washington, sets policy for protecting non-federal lands in the gorge. It also serves as an appeals board for land-use decisions in the area. Its forthcoming task: approving the first climate change action plan for the gorge, as mandated by the management plan approved two years ago.Miller, who will take over as chair in January, has a background in economic development. As one of the youngest members of the tribal council at Warm Springs, she worked to bring marijuana cultivation and carbon markets to the reservation. She currently works for nonprofit Vibrant Tribal Economies, studying tribal economic health.Miller remembers visiting the scenic area as a child with her grandmother and great-grandmother, who taught her about the removal of the tribes and instilled the importance of the river to tribal identity. She also learned to be innovative to carry on tribal values, including by working within a system that has long oppressed Native people.“My grandmas really wanted me to be visible, but they also didn’t want us to be tokens,” said Miller. “They (taught me) that even though these systems were built to destroy us, that we had to really go in and understand them, master them, and find different ways forward, better ways.”– Gosia Wozniacka; gwozniacka@oregonian.com; @gosiawozniackaOur journalism needs your support.

Readers respond: Sanctioned homeless camps won’t work,Letters to the editor,Opinion,"Dec. 01, 2022, 6:01 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Letters to the editor | The OregonianJuliana James’ letter makes some good points for an idyllic world, (“Readers respond: Sanctioned camps a start,” Nov. 25). She and many others advocate for these wonderful camps with physical and mental health services for people who are homeless.However, everything breaks down when she mentions rules for “no drugs, no weapons and no aggression.” The no-drugs requirement is precisely why the city’s “campers” do not choose to go to available shelters now. They are addicts and don’t want available rehab either. It’s also dreaming to think that weapons and aggression will not be allowed. They aren’t allowed in prisons either, but somehow manage to be fashioned for aggressive encounters.What about the hundreds of “campers” who would choose to not take advantage of these wonderful camp sites because of the rules? Are they rounded up, herded into them and forced to participate in drug and mental health rehab? This all harkens back to the 2009 movie “District 9"" that was inspired by the infamous District 6 area of Cape Town South Africa during the apartheid era.We must face the fact that drugs are the root problem here, just has always been the case.

New York City will forcibly treat people with severe mental illness if necessary to get them off the streets,The Associated Press,Health,"Nov. 30, 2022, 11:34 a.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 5:30 a.m.",138,"FILE - Homeless Outreach personnel reach out to a person sleeping on a bench in the Manhattan subway system, Monday, Feb. 21, 2022, in New York.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)APNEW!138sharesBy The Associated PressNew York City’s mayor on Tuesday said he was directing police and city medics to be more aggressive about getting severely mentally ill people off the streets and subways and into treatment, even if it means involuntarily hospitalizing some people who refuse care.“These New Yorkers and hundreds of others like them are in urgent need of treatment, yet often refuse it when offered,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference, noting the pervasive problem of mental illness has long been out in the open.“No more walking by or looking away,” the mayor said, calling it “a moral obligation to act.”The mayor’s directive marks the latest attempt to ease a crisis decades in the making. It would give outreach workers, city hospitals and first responders, including police, discretion to involuntarily hospitalize anyone they deem a danger to themselves or unable to care for themselves.“The very nature of their illnesses keeps them from realizing they need intervention and support,” Adams said. “Without that intervention, they remain lost and isolated from society, tormented by delusions and disordered thinking. They cycle in and out of hospitals and jails.”State law generally limits the ability of authorities to force someone into treatment unless they are a danger to themselves, but Adams said it was a “myth” that the law required a person to be behaving in an “outrageously dangerous” or suicidal way before a police officer or medical worker could take action.As part of its initiative, the city is developing a phone line that would allow police officers to consult with clinicians.The mayor’s announcement was condemned as wrong-headed by some civil rights groups and advocates for the homeless.“The Mayor is playing fast and loose with the legal rights of New Yorkers and is not dedicating the resources necessary to address the mental health crises that affect our communities,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director the New York Civil Liberties Union.“Forcing people into treatment is a failed strategy for connecting people to long-term treatment and care,” she said.The Coalition for the Homeless also denounced the mayor’s plan, saying the city should focus on expanding access to voluntary psychiatric treatment.“Mayor Adams continues to get it wrong when it comes to his reliance on ineffective surveillance, policing, and involuntary transport and treatment of people with mental illness,” said the coalition’s executive director, Jacquelyn Simone.Other groups welcomed the mayor’s overtures even if they remain skeptical about how police would ultimately handle the mentally ill.“We agree with the spirit of Mayor Adams address, which, you know, very much centers around confronting this human problem with compassion and sensitivity,” said Jeffrey Berman, an attorney for the mental health unit of the Legal Aid Society.“We need fixes within the criminal legal system so that those people who do end up arrested can find a way out with treatment and support in the community and a road to real recovery and not jail,” he said.The Legal Aid Society, along with several community-based defender services, said the mayor was correct in noting “decades of dysfunction” in mental health care. They argued state lawmakers “must no longer ‘punt’” to address the crisis and approve legislation that would offer treatment, not jail, for people with mental health issues.State lawmakers have been considering such legislation that would widen diversion programs for the mentally ill, a move supported by public defender groups.Adams has called for an expansion of the use of 1999′s “Kendra’s Law,” which allows courts to order defendants with mental illness to complete treatment.The law was named after Kendra Webdale, who died after being pushed onto the subway tracks by a man with a history of mental illness.Adams was thrust into the city’s mental health crisis when just days after being sworn into office a different New York woman was shoved into the path of incoming train, stoking public concerns over random attacks by people struggling with mental illness and homelessnes.Soon after, the mayor announced a subway safety plan and vowed to expand outreach teams. Critics called the plan a crackdown on the mentally ill and the homeless.The mayor said he has begun deploying teams of clinicians and police officers to patrol the busiest subway stations. The city also was rolling out training to police officers and other first responders to help them provide “compassionate care” in situations that could cause the involuntary removal of a person showing signs of mental illness in public places.“It is not acceptable for us to see someone who clearly needs help and walk past,” Adams said.A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the city’s plan builds on mutual efforts to increase capacity at psychiatric hospitals, as well as expand outreach teams in subways.__________Maysoon Khan, a corps member for the

‘Goonies’ house in Astoria sells to a fan who wants to protect the landmark,Janet Eastman,Real Estate,"Dec. 02, 2022, 5:52 p.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 5:33 p.m.",3308,"18See inside “The Goonies” house that's for saleNEW!3,308sharesBy Janet Eastman | The Oregonian/OregonLiveHey you guyyys! The likely new owner of a Victorian-era home in Astoria, known as “The Goonies” house, is a fan of the classic coming-of-age movie about friendships and treasure hunting, and he promises to preserve and protect the landmark, says listing agent Jordan Miller of John L. Scott Real Estate.The deal is expected to close in mid January, says Miller, and the new owner, a self-described serial entrepreneur, will make his name known at that time.The buyer teases in a Q&A to “die-hard Goonies” that he wants their help rebuilding the contraption that opens the front gate.“Of course, no one gets in unless they do the truffle shuffle,” he jokes in his written statement.The restored private residence at 368 38th St. was listed for sale at $1.65 million on Nov. 17. An offer was accepted six days later, according to public record.“After the word spread that the property was for sale, we received multiple offers, at asking price and higher, and we have a full back-up offer,” says Miller.Seller Sandi Preston is passing along movie memorabilia she has collected or has been given, and some of the furniture in the home, restored to its original 1896 style, may also be sold to the buyer, says Miller.Miller has also received an offer on the house next door, at 384 38th Ave., which was for sale at $550,000 by Preston’s daughter. The 1885 house may be occupied by a childhood friend of the new owner of the Goonies’ house.Miller says the potential new owner first saw “The Goonies” when it was released in 1985 with his mom, brother, sister and his friend, Michael (”Mikey”).He considers himself a “Goonie,” which he defines as friends sticking together.“My childhood friendships were, and still are, instrumental to my development and success,” he told Miller. “Buying this home is one huge step in showing your dreams can become reality with the right friends around you. You don’t have to be rich to achieve your dreams, but you do need a strong support group, honesty and a desire for adventure.”He recalls his first reaction to the movie reinforced his continuing beliefs that a child’s imagination is limitless, adventure is to be embraced and you can’t predict where chance leads you.He sees buying the storied property as a way to relive his childhood, and Astoria as “magical with the almost daily fog that can either turn into pure sunshine or a cozy day at the coast.”As the next owner of “The Goonies” house, he says he is most excited to “duh! Live in the Goon Docks.”HistorySearching for One-Eyed Willy's treasure in ""The Goonies.""Warner Bros.Since the adventure comedy’s release in 1985, Goonies groupies have made pilgrimages to Astoria, in the northwest edge of Oregon, and converged at 368 38th St. to get a glimpse of the off-limits old house saved by the film’s unlikely young heroes.Fictional brothers Brand Walsh (played by Josh Brolin) and Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) and their misfit friends from the wrong side of the tracks (the “Goon Docks”) fought to keep the brothers’ family house from developers.The real-life homeowner, Sandi Preston, who bought the property in 2001, at first allowed fans inside before she restored the two-story house.Most of the visitors were respectful, she said, but sometimes souvenir seekers pulled off pieces of the wallpaper near the bunk beds. She then closed the doors to the house built in 1896 except during Goonies Day tours, organized to celebrate the movie’s anniversary.Preston says she wants to downsize from the two-story house with 2,336 square feet of living space.There is also a finished attic and an unfinished basement where Steven Spielberg, who wrote “The Goonies” story that was made into a screenplay by Chris Columbus, had a desk during filming. He met with director Richard Donner there, says Miller.— Janet Eastman | 503-294-4072jeastman@oregonian.com | @janeteastmanOur journalism needs your support.

Portland man convicted of raping 9 women gets 58 years in prison: ‘He simply did not care who he hurt’,Zane Sparling,Public Safety,"Dec. 02, 2022, 1:38 p.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 1:13 p.m.",319,"Rafael G. Alcon-Ayala, now 32, was sentenced to more than 58 years in state prison during a hearing in Multnomah County Circuit Court on Friday, Dec. 2, 2022.Zane Sparling/The OregonianNEW!319sharesBy Zane Sparling | The Oregonian/OregonLiveA Portland man who preyed on his friends and used his connections as a club promoter to rape at least nine women was sentenced to more than 58 years in prison Friday.Rafael Alcon-Ayala showed no remorse inside the Multnomah County Central Courthouse as five of those women described in person or in statements how they were physically helpless or unconscious when the now 32-year-old attacked them.“Mr. Alcon-Ayala is a predator. He is a serial rapist. There is no other way to describe it,” Deputy District Attorney Nicole Hermann said during the hearing. “He simply did not care who he hurt.”The prosecutor said Alcon-Ayala’s sex crimes continued even after he knew he was under investigation, had been confronted by his own girlfriend and was even compelled to provide a DNA sample to authorities with a warrant.In court documents and the statements spoken or read aloud at court, the women described a pattern of behavior — saying they had planned to meet up with Alcon-Ayala for a drink but remembered little or nothing of what followed. Multiple women said they reported the crime and were treated at a hospital the next morning or shortly thereafter.“Victims of rape have to live with these impacts for the rest of their lives. It’s only fair that rapists should endure the same punishment,” one of the women said in a recording played during the hearing. “Anything else is unjust and frankly insulting.”According to court files, Gresham police officers first interviewed a woman who said she had been raped by Alcon-Ayala the night before in July 2016. Evidence of sexual assault was collected at the hospital the next day, the records say.Portland police took similar reports in December 2017 and February 2018 from unrelated women who said they where raped by Alcon-Ayala. Evidence was collected at a hospital in both cases.All three women said they knew Alcon-Ayala as a promoter for the now-defunct Dirty nightclub in downtown Portland.It’s unclear whether authorities advanced the investigation until July 2019, when a fourth woman told Gresham police she had been raped by Alcon-Ayala the night before, according to court records. Evidence collection was completed at a hospital, and authorities also obtained surveillance footage.After the warrant for his DNA turned up a match, Alcon-Ayala was arrested in January 2020, spurring numerous other women to come forward with allegations dating back to 2010.He was ultimately charged in an indictment with raping or sexually abusing 12 women, but was acquitted in charges relating to one of the women. Two other women decided not to proceed with their cases after Alcon-Ayala was found guilty on multiple counts of first-degree rape and sex abuse over the course of two jury trials in September 2021 and this October.During the sentencing hearing, defense attorney Alicia Hercher called for a punishment of 25 years, while the state sought a 68-year term in prison. Alcon-Ayala asked his attorney to read aloud a statement, which did not address his convictions but instead described himself as a former addict who had completed rehabilitation programs while in custody.He apologized once — to his defense attorney — for the shoddy handwriting of the statement.“I did not come here to beg for mercy. I expect the worst,” the statement said.Multnomah County Circuit Judge Thomas Ryan then sentenced Alcon-Ayala to 58 years and four months in prison, with credit for time served but no ability to earn time off for good behavior. He will have to register for life as a sex offender.The judge said he hoped the women who spoke during the hearing or sat in the benches would seek out help and find solace from the pain of what he called “raw acts of violence.”“You deserve to feel safe again,” Ryan said. “The help you can get is not letting this horrific trauma, that almost defies words, from overly influence your life going forward.”— Zane Sparling; zsparling@oregonian.com; 503-319-7083; @pdxzaneOur journalism needs your support.

"Portland’s plan to curb Central Eastside crime, homelessness replicates Old Town’s. Will it work?",Catalina Gaitán,Portland,"Dec. 02, 2022, 3:42 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 6:46 p.m.",199,"Rapid Response crews clean up an encampment on May 11, 2022 located near NW Broadway and NW Flanders Street.NEW!199sharesBy Catalina Gaitán | The Oregonian/OregonLive.comAnother coalition of Portland business and neighborhood leaders has persuaded Mayor Ted Wheeler to order coordinated sweeps of homeless encampments in an effort to curb crime and visible homelessness, this time in the Central Eastside Industrial District.The strategy — a “90-day reset” — is modeled after one the mayor adopted in Old Town this spring. Whether it worked there depends on whom you ask.Wheeler made the latest pledge on Tuesday to the Central Eastside Industrial District — a mix of 1,400 commercial, professional and industrial businesses on 622 acres along the Willamette River, mostly in Southeast Portland — in response to safety concerns highlighted by Salt & Straw’s announcement last week that it may move its headquarters.!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();Jessie Burke, who chairs the Old Town Community Association and owns the Society Hotel on Northwest Third Avenue, said the strategy was successful there. She authored the reset plan after Wheeler declared a homelessness state of emergency in February, calling on the city to reduce the number of tents in Old Town by 33%.The plan also sought additional outdoor lighting in the area, 60 inches of sidewalk clearance in the neighborhood and the removal of garbage with the help of Downtown Portland Clean & Safe, among other strategies to increase cleanliness, public safety and accessibility in the neighborhood.Even though the 90 days ended in June, the plan is still guiding work in the neighborhood, Burke said, and conditions have improved. “In general, it’s going much better,” Burke said.By the end of April, the city had removed 137 tents from Old Town, a 300% increase from that time in 2021. An additional 206 were removed in May, a 450% increase from that time last year, according to city data.Since the program ended, Burke said the number of tents on Old Town sidewalks is down to about 70 from 400. A Clean & Safe truck cleans the neighborhood seven days a week, and workers say they often make three trips per day to the dump with litter they’ve collected.“The 90 days didn’t really matter – it wasn’t the timeline, it was more a work plan for all of us,” she said. “And to quote Teddy Roosevelt, ‘Complaining without a suggestion is just whining.’”During a press conference in June about the strategy, police Chief Chuck Lovell said the city’s response in Old Town led to reported drug offenses dropping by half, a 93% decrease in trespassing reports and a 13% decrease in vandalism between March 22 and May 20, compared with the prior 60-day period.Serious problems remain. In September, two people died in stabbings in 24 hours in Old Town, highlighting the fragile condition of the district. And in October, parking patrol agents with the city said they avoided solo trips to Old Town due to safety concerns.Advocates for the homeless say sweeps in the industrial district will further traumatize the population.Scott Kerman, executive director of Blanchet House, which offers free meals and other services in Old Town, called the sweeps “tornados,” which saw unsheltered people returning to discover their homes gone and their neighborhood destroyed.Since the sweeps in Old Town, Kerman said more people have been coming into Blanchet House experiencing heightened anxiety and mental health issues. They have also been in greater need of clothing, blankets and sleeping bags as theirs have been taken.Those left behind were often those with the highest need in terms of mental illness, substance abuse and chronic homelessness – all of which “ratcheted up tension” in the neighborhood, he said.“We devalue the kind of community people form in these encampments,” Kerman said. “We only really hear about the violence and we focus on things like trash, but there’s honest community and friendship and support that exists within these houseless communities and encampments, and sweeps can really destroy that.”While Burke agreed the sweeps could be traumatic, she said allowing people to camp on downtown streets and sidewalks was less humane.“City infrastructure never intended for humans to live on the sidewalk,” she said. “Rats are chewing through people’s tents while they’re sleeping.”Before a 90-day reset goes into effect in the Central Eastside, Kerman said he hoped city leaders would reach out to Blanchet House and other agencies like Street Roots, Portland Rescue Mission and Central City Concern to do “proactive problem solving” and identify some unintended consequences that may arise from the reset.“We may not all agree on the plans being offered, but I do understand there’s a lot of relief that at least there are some plans on the table,” Kerman said. “And what I would rather do is find ways to work with our partners to improve these things than to simply throw stones at it.”Prior to the sweeps in Old Town, the city reached out to people with available shelter spots and free transportation to the shelters. But Kerman said many unhoused people are “shelter-resistant” because they have had traumatic experiences at a shelter and don’t feel safe there.Only 18 people living inside the estimated 164 tents that were removed took the city up on the offers, Cody Bowman, a spokesman in Wheeler’s office, said in May.While the full scope of the new “reset” isn’t yet clear, Wheeler indicated that removing encampments would be one of its pillars. Wheeler also said he planned to address gun violence in the area by recruiting and retaining more police officers.Also on Tuesday, Portland City Council approved $27 million in funding that will build three 250-person, city-operated camping sites and other initiatives to reduce street camping.The mayor plans to meet again with Central Eastside business leaders on Friday. He has not said when the plan would begin.-- Catalina Gaitán, cgaitan@oregonian.com, @catalingaitan_Our journalism needs your support.

Oregon Measure 114 gun control challenge heard in court,Maxine Bernstein,Public Safety,"Dec. 02, 2022, 6:56 p.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 3:30 p.m.",979,"State police announced Friday that the state's initial permitting process to buy a gun will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards due to the short window the agency has to put new law in place.APNEW!979sharesBy Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveA federal judge Friday heard sharply contrasting arguments about whether gun control Measure 114's regulations are constitutional in what she described as a very complicated case amid a new legal landscape.After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled next Thursday.If the measure is allowed to become state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Dec. 8.The courtroom’s public gallery immediately erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Marshall said Oregon will join 12 other states that already ban large-capacity magazines.Read text of the state of Oregon’s defense of Measure 114“We will become the 13th. I don’t think there’s a really good reason we should be the only ones to be enjoined,” he said, in response to the critics call for a temporary restraining order to be followed by a preliminary injunction.The proponents of the measure, a grassroots interfaith group Lift Every Voice Oregon, drafted it to reduce mass shootings, homicides and suicides. Blocking the ban on large-capacity magazines would create a significant risk of a “single individual killing large numbers of people,” Marshall said.“These are not useful for self-defense. They’re extremely dangerous,” he said.The Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association. A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday.Read the text of the first legal challenge to Measure 114Most of Friday’s legal arguments centered on the ban on magazine capacity.Immergut asked lawyers who have sued the state to explain what evidence backed up their argument that magazines with more than 10 rounds are commonly used in self-defense.She also sought to find out whether they believe the court has any authority to regulate any gun or any type of ammunition, including body armor-piercing bullets or machine guns.The judge further pressed to understand whether she can factor current usage of large-capacity magazines in her decision.If a magazine with a certain number of rounds that seems innocuous but has been used “in a way that perhaps wasn’t contemplated,” such as in mass shootings, can the magazine then be considered dangerous and unusual, she asked.Attorney John Kaempf, on behalf of the firearms federation, three sheriffs and two gun store owners, and attorney WIlliam Bergstrom, representing the Second Amendment Federation, argued that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are prolific nationwide and have been commonly used for self-defense by law-abiding citizens since the 18th century.“Under Bruen, it’s a new day,” Kaempf argued, referring to the landmark ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June, which struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home.In the high court’s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the 6-3 majority directed lower courts to use a new “text-and-history” standard when evaluating challenges to firearms regulations. Courts must determine whether “the Second Amendment’s plain text” protects the conduct in which the plaintiff wishes to engage and, if it does, then decide if the regulation “is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”Kaempf argued that there’s a presumptive right to bear arms and that the Supreme Court ruling this summer made it clear that government can’t restrict the use of weapons that are in common use. If magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are barred, it “would make Oregonians less safe,” he said, adding that law-abiding people would be hamstrung “when ambushed in the dark.”“We just want you to preserve the status quo -- the way it’s been for decades,” he said. “One second of 114 going into effect on Dec. 8 , and we have irreparable injury.”He told the judge it’s not up to her to weigh or balance current societal concerns.“I have great respect for Your Honor. And what Bruen is telling you is it’s not up to you,” he said, pointing at the judge. “We already had balancing. It happened in 1791 when we passed the Second Amendment. The balancing (test) is over.”Immergut noted that the Supreme Court ruling, though, made it clear that its decision is not a “regulatory strait jacket” and allows a variety of gun regulations.Marshall, of the attorney general’s office, argued that large-capacity magazines have entered U.S. commerce only in recent years, citing statistics that they made up 1% of firearm use in 1955 and, by 1995, 7% of use.He also urged the court to consider an analysis done by Lucy P. Allen, an economic consultant who studied the NRA’s Armed Citizen database of shootings from January 2011 through May 2017. Allen found that it was extraordinarily rare for a person, when using guns in self-defense, to fire more than 10 rounds. Allen found that armed defenders fired 2.2 rounds on average.Bergstrom, representing the Second Amendment Foundation, argued that the Supreme Court’s guidance in the New York case restricts regulations of anything but “dangerous and unusual arms.” He said magazines of more than 10 rounds have not proven to be unusual or dangerous.In fact, he said, Americans have owned as many as half a billion of these magazines.Kevin Starrett, head of the Oregon Firearms Federation, submitted a declaration, writing that “perhaps a majority” of all guns sold in the United States come from the factory with magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, and rifles with magazines that hold up to 30 rounds.Even if the magazines are common now, the judge asked, what’s the evidence these larger-capacity magazines are commonly used for self-defense. She further questioned if there’s a point where a certain number of rounds in a magazine would make it dangerous.“There may well be. ... It’s well above 10,” Bergstrom responded. He pointed to a 2021 National Firearms Survey that found guns with magazines that carry more than 10 rounds are most commonly used for recreational target shooting, home defense, hunting and defense outside the home.The judge confirmed that Measure 114 doesn’t restrict anyone from having multiple magazines that hold up to 10 rounds, and that larger-capacity magazines can still be used on the shooting range, in shooting competitions on private property or for recreational purposes, such as hunting.“You would agree that law enforcement conceivably should have weapons that are different than a private citizen should have. Wouldn’t you?” Immergut asked Kaempf.“No,” Kaempf responded. “I don’t see a historical tradition of that.”Though much of the discussion centered on the measure’s restriction on gun magazines, Kaempf also argued that the measure’s new permit requirement to buy a gun “now puts a presumption of guilt” on the applicant who will have to prove to a “permit agent” why they’re “good enough” to get a permit.“Are you saying background checks aren’t constitutional?” the judge questioned. No, Kaempf said.Several members of Lift Every Voice Oregon, including chief petitioner Marilyn Keller, attended the hearing. Union County Sheriff Cody Bowen, who joined with the firearms federation to try to block the measure, and Klamath County Sheriff Chris Kaber, not involved in any of the lawsuits, were among those who also attended the hearing.“I’m frustrated we’re here to begin with,” Bowen said afterward, adding that he thinks the focus shouldn’t be on guns but on increasing Oregon’s mental health and addiction services. He said he still doubts the state will be ready to put the measure into effect, contending the state police computer systems aren’t even compatible with some local sheriff and police systems and current background checks for gun sales are significantly backed up.As of Friday, Oregon State Police had 41,160 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold, and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.A new permit application is in the “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies, and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.“With BM114 becoming law on December 8, 2022, this gives Oregon State Police a very short window to develop a program and have technology available for use on day 1 of the new law. Because of this, the Permit-to-Purchase program at Oregon State Police will be a manual paper process until new technical systems can be designed and implemented,” a state police statement said. “OSP does not have the ability to update the Livescan software. We are researching a solution.”Late Friday, the newly-filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114's permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.Kaber, sheriff of Klamath County, said he came to court Friday to support his colleagues. Whichever way the judge rules, he said, he’ll do everything he can to make sure “law-abiding people” in his county can obtain guns through the permit system, if necessary, though he doesn’t support it.To obtain a temporary restraining order, the plaintiffs suing the state must show that gun rights advocates will suffer immediate “irreparable injury” if the measure is allowed to take effect. Such an order is usually a stopgap step that lasts until the court can review more substantial evidence on whether to grant a permanent injunction.Later Friday, the Springfield Police Department issued a statement, saying it won’t be ready to accept permits to purchase guns if the measure takes effect on Thursday, but said it’s continuing to work with other agencies to adopt a permitting program. The police department also warned the public that changes in staffing to support a permitting program will impact police service on the street.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

Should you have to justify your compensation expectation to a recruiter?,Dear Sam,Business,"Dec. 02, 2022, 8:01 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 8:00 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Dear Sam | Expert resume, interview and job search adviceDear Sam: I am applying for a Senior Technical Program Manager, and the recruiter emailed me multiple questions, including this: “What are you looking for compensation and WHY? Please explain.” I initially answered that my salary expectations were negotiable and that I didn’t know the exact salary range they were offering for this position. The recruiter provided their targeted range in response but persisted in asking me the same question as to “why” I wanted the range I was seeking. My initial thinking is to answer along these lines:“Great question. Given a 0-15% bonus plan, I seek a base compensation in the $XXXK-$XXXK per year range. Why? For one, I have historically facilitated the generation of new revenue, and I will pay for myself. Second, this is a fair expectation, given my expertise and prevailing wage rates. For example, with the latest hiring bubble, salaries rose dramatically. Not even considering this, and given 10% inflation over the last year, the lower-end rate barely gives me a raise over my current unadjusted base pay rate. If hired, I will be worth it and more.”What are your thoughts? – DavidDear David: It is really interesting the recruiter is asking you to justify your compensation requirements. In contemplating that, it does make sense the recruiter would want insight into your thinking. In addition, it provides an opportunity to “sell yourself” and potentially provide a reason for the employer to think beyond pre-established compensation bands. I love your response, but I suggest omitting the second part of your statement. I think short and sweet is the way to go with your answer. I would simply state, “Why? I have historically facilitated the generation of new revenue, and I will pay for myself. Additionally, this is more than a fair expectation given my expertise, prevailing wage rates, inflation, and a cost of living adjustment for the Boston area.” If the recruiter has additional questions, he or she will undoubtedly prompt them following your response, but I think over-justifying your expectation weakens your case. Great job, and I wish you much success!5 ways to answer a potential employer's compensation questionWhen asked for a salary requirement, there are a few standard approaches, none of which is risk-free.Samantha Nolan is an Advanced Personal Branding Strategist and Career Expert, founder and CEO of Nolan Branding.

Mauna Loa vs. Mount St. Helens: How the eruptions differ and what NW volcanoes are doing now,staff and wire reports,Environment,"Nov. 30, 2022, 5:23 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 8:26 a.m.",0,"Lava pours out of the summit crater of Mauna Loa about 6:35 a.m. Monday, Nov. 28, 2022, as seen from Gilbert Kahele Recreation Area on Maunakea, Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano,  began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. (Chelsea Jensen/West Hawaii Today via AP)APNEW!By staff and wire reportsWashington state’s Mount St. Helens erupted catastrophically in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles away.Mauna Loa is not exploding like Mount St. Helens did. The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa and Mount St. Helens erupt in different ways,” said Liz Westby, a geologist based at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington. “Mauna Loa trends toward eruptions of fluid-flowing lava (compositionally called basalt), which over time, has built its broad shield shape.”In contrast, she said, “Mount St. Helens trends toward eruptions of thicker, more viscous lava (compositionally called dacite and andesite) that doesn’t flow very far and can pile up near the vent to form lava domes. Gases can be trapped in the thick and viscous magma as it waits in the shallow magma reservoir and the systems can become pressurized, sometimes leading to explosive eruptions.”Westby added, “With lava flowing from fissures high on the flank of Mauna Loa, the chance of an explosive eruption is greatly diminished (gases are escaping).”Mauna Loa’s hotter, drier and more fluid magma allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is called a shield volcano because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.On Friday, the United States Geological Service posted a routine update on Northwest volcanoes:Activity Update: All volcanoes in the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington are at normal background levels of activity. These include Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams in Washington State; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Newberry, and Crater Lake in Oregon.Recent Observations: Over the past week, earthquakes were located at Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Hood, including a seismic swarm at Mount St. Helens from November 20–21 and a M 2.1 earthquake at Mount Rainier on November 21. These earthquakes are consistent with background levels of seismicity at each volcano. Activity at other Cascade volcanoes is also at background levels.Westby noted Mauna Loa has historically had explosive eruptions, although not like Mount St. Helens’ 1980 lateral blast, and Mount St. Helens has had fluid flows of basalt. The Ape Cave lava tube on the south side of Mount St. Helens is an example of a basalt flow, she said.New Webcam shows fissure 3!! https://t.co/nWh9jyd4XJNWRZ eruption #MaunaLoa continues.

On the Big Island, the first eruption in 38 years of the world’s largest active volcano dredged up bad memories among some Hawaii residents who have been through harrowing volcanic experiences in the past.It was just four years ago that Nicole Skilling fled her home near a community where more than 700 residences were destroyed by lava. She relocated to the South Kona area, only to find herself packing her car with food and supplies this week after Mauna Loa erupted late Sunday.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks.

New York City will forcibly treat people with severe mental illness if necessary to get them off the streets,The Associated Press,Health,"Nov. 30, 2022, 11:34 a.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 5:30 a.m.",135,"FILE - Homeless Outreach personnel reach out to a person sleeping on a bench in the Manhattan subway system, Monday, Feb. 21, 2022, in New York. In New York City's latest effort to address a mental health crisis on its streets and subways, Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday, Nov. 29, that authorities would more aggressively intervene to help people in need of treatment, saying there was ""a moral obligation"" to do so, even if it means providing care to those who don't ask for it. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)APNEW!135sharesBy The Associated PressNew York City’s mayor on Tuesday said he was directing police and city medics to be more aggressive about getting severely mentally ill people off the streets and subways and into treatment, even if it means involuntarily hospitalizing some people who refuse care.“These New Yorkers and hundreds of others like them are in urgent need of treatment, yet often refuse it when offered,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference, noting the pervasive problem of mental illness has long been out in the open.“No more walking by or looking away,” the mayor said, calling it “a moral obligation to act.”The mayor’s directive marks the latest attempt to ease a crisis decades in the making. It would give outreach workers, city hospitals and first responders, including police, discretion to involuntarily hospitalize anyone they deem a danger to themselves or unable to care for themselves.“The very nature of their illnesses keeps them from realizing they need intervention and support,” Adams said. “Without that intervention, they remain lost and isolated from society, tormented by delusions and disordered thinking. They cycle in and out of hospitals and jails.”State law generally limits the ability of authorities to force someone into treatment unless they are a danger to themselves, but Adams said it was a “myth” that the law required a person to be behaving in an “outrageously dangerous” or suicidal way before a police officer or medical worker could take action.As part of its initiative, the city is developing a phone line that would allow police officers to consult with clinicians.The mayor’s announcement was condemned as wrong-headed by some civil rights groups and advocates for the homeless.“The Mayor is playing fast and loose with the legal rights of New Yorkers and is not dedicating the resources necessary to address the mental health crises that affect our communities,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director the New York Civil Liberties Union.“Forcing people into treatment is a failed strategy for connecting people to long-term treatment and care,” she said.The Coalition for the Homeless also denounced the mayor’s plan, saying the city should focus on expanding access to voluntary psychiatric treatment.“Mayor Adams continues to get it wrong when it comes to his reliance on ineffective surveillance, policing, and involuntary transport and treatment of people with mental illness,” said the coalition’s executive director, Jacquelyn Simone.Other groups welcomed the mayor’s overtures even if they remain skeptical about how police would ultimately handle the mentally ill.“We agree with the spirit of Mayor Adams address, which, you know, very much centers around confronting this human problem with compassion and sensitivity,” said Jeffrey Berman, an attorney for the mental health unit of the Legal Aid Society.“We need fixes within the criminal legal system so that those people who do end up arrested can find a way out with treatment and support in the community and a road to real recovery and not jail,” he said.The Legal Aid Society, along with several community-based defender services, said the mayor was correct in noting “decades of dysfunction” in mental health care. They argued state lawmakers “must no longer ‘punt’” to address the crisis and approve legislation that would offer treatment, not jail, for people with mental health issues.State lawmakers have been considering such legislation that would widen diversion programs for the mentally ill, a move supported by public defender groups.Adams has called for an expansion of the use of 1999's “Kendra’s Law,” which allows courts to order defendants with mental illness to complete treatment.The law was named after Kendra Webdale, who died after being pushed onto the subway tracks by a man with a history of mental illness.Adams was thrust into the city’s mental health crisis when just days after being sworn into office a different New York woman was shoved into the path of incoming train, stoking public concerns over random attacks by people struggling with mental illness and homelessnes.Soon after, the mayor announced a subway safety plan and vowed to expand outreach teams. Critics called the plan a crackdown on the mentally ill and the homeless.The mayor said he has begun deploying teams of clinicians and police officers to patrol the busiest subway stations. The city also was rolling out training to police officers and other first responders to help them provide “compassionate care” in situations that could cause the involuntary removal of a person showing signs of mental illness in public places.“It is not acceptable for us to see someone who clearly needs help and walk past,” Adams said.A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the city’s plan builds on mutual efforts to increase capacity at psychiatric hospitals, as well as expand outreach teams in subways.__________Maysoon Khan, a corps member for the

Trail Blazers broadcaster Evoca TV warns it will shut down without more funding ,Mike Rogoway,Business,"Nov. 30, 2022, 5:30 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 5:07 p.m.",0,"Evoca uses a streaming box based on Google's Android operating system. Subscriptions are $30 a month, including $5 to rent the box.Evoca TVNEW!By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLiveEvoca TV, an Idaho company that broadcasts local channels and pro sports in Portland and other western cities, warned Wednesday that it is running out of money and may shut down at the end of the year.That would shut off the cheapest option to see Portland Trail Blazers broadcasts.“This is a difficult economy for a company like ours to raise the funding that we need to grow,” Evoca wrote in a note to customers. “Should we be unable to raise more capital, we are sad to say that Evoca TV will discontinue operations and programming on December 31st, 2022.”Evoca said it won’t bill customers for their December service and won’t require them to return their equipment if the company does shut down. The company declined to say how much it has raised or how much it needs to continue operating. Evoca charges $30 a month for a package that includes local broadcast networks, some streaming channels and Root Sports -- a regional network that carries the Portland Trail Blazers, Seattle Mariners and Seattle Kraken. Evoca also operates in Idaho, Colorado, Arizona and Michigan, offering broadcasts carried in each local market.Root Sports is not available from the most popular streaming services. Those that do offer it charge upwards of $80 a month. That makes Evoca the most affordable option to the Trail Blazers on TV.Evoca has marketed its service heavily during Blazers broadcasts, pitching its service through commercials, on-court advertisements and free tickets to games. Its offerings are much more limited than other subscription TV services, though, and it’s unclear whether it’s targeting a market large enough to support the business.Venture capital investment in young companies is down sharply this year, reflecting greater pessimism about the global economic outlook. That’s led to layoffs and shutdowns at startups across the country.-- Mike Rogoway | mrogoway@oregonian.com | Twitter: @rogoway |If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",43,"'2022':128 '30':15,175 '31st':127 '5':19 '80':240 'account':350 'across':333 'advertis':272 'afford':248 'also':207 'android':10 'arizona':212 'avail':225 'base':6 'bill':134 'blazer':76,200,253,262 'box':5 'box.evoca':23 'broadcast':35,77,184,216,263 'business.venture':305 'capit':111,306 'carri':196,217 'channel':37,188 'charg':174,237 'cheapest':70 'citi':46 'colorado':211 'commerci':268 'compani':33,85,151,156,310 'compens':362 'continu':171 'countri':335 'court':271 'custom':103,135 'decemb':126,138 'declin':157 'difficult':81 'discontinu':121 'econom':322 'economi':82 'end':62 'enough':301 'equip':148 'evoca':1,97,118,129,173,206,245 'free':274 'fund':91 'game':277 'global':321 'googl':8 'greater':317 'grow':96 'heavili':260 'idaho':32,210 'includ':18,182 'invest':307 'kraken':205 'larg':300 'layoff':328 'led':326 'like':86 'limit':283 'link':355 'local':36,183,220 'make':244 'marin':202 'market':257,299 'market.root':221 'may':57,360 'michigan':214 'mike':26,336 'money':55 'month':17,177,242 'mrogoway@oregonian.com':338 'much':161,167,281 'need':94,169 'network':185,194 'note':101 'offer':215,235,279 'on-court':269 'one':352 'oper':11,122,172,208 'option':71,249 'oregonian/oregonliveevoca':29 'outlook':323 'packag':180 'pessim':318 'pitch':264 'popular':229 'portland':42,74,198 'pro':39 'product':345 'program':124 'purchas':343 'rais':89,109,164 'receiv':361 'reflect':316 'region':193 'regist':347 'rent':21 'requir':143 'return':146 'rogoway':27,337,340 'root':190 'run':52 'sad':114 'said':130 'say':116,159 'seattl':201,204 'see':73 'servic':139,231,259,266,288 'sharpli':313 'shut':58,67,153 'shutdown':330 'site':358 'sport':40,191,222 'startup':332 'stream':4,187,230 'subscript':13,286 'support':303 'system':12 'target':297 'though':289 'ticket':275 'trail':75,199,252 'tv':30,119,287 'tv.evoca':255 'tvnew':24 'twitter':339 'unabl':107 'unclear':293 'upward':238 'use':2 'warn':47 'wednesday':48 'western':45 'whether':294 'won':132,141 'would':66 'wrote':98 'year':315 'year.that':65 'young':309","{""The Oregonian""}"

"The last Blockbuster video store in Bend inspires a Netflix show, nostalgia-loving customers, and more",Kristi Turnquist,Life & Culture,"Dec. 02, 2022, 9:56 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 7:59 a.m.",183,"Sandi Harding is the general manager of the last Blockbuster video store on the planet, located in Bend, Oregon. (Photo: Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian)NEW!183sharesBy Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIt’s been the subject of numerous news stories, received national TV exposure, and helped inspire a Netflix comedy series. But business goes on as usual at the Bend Blockbuster.Of course, as the last Blockbuster video rental store on the planet, that business includes watching tourists taking photos outside, taking care of visitors who stock up on merchandise inside, and dealing with the occasional couple planning to get married in the middle of the store.On an October Friday morning, general manager Sandi Harding is pushing a rolling cart loaded with Blockbuster-blue sweatpants toward the store’s entry, near a “Be Kind. Please Rewind” sign. The store hasn’t opened yet, but there’s already activity in the parking lot of the modest strip mall where the last Blockbuster on the planet is located. A van with Washington state plates pulls up, and a woman gets out to snap a photo on her phone of the store’s exterior, with its distinctive yellow-and-blue signage.The last Blockbuster video store on the planet is in Bend, Oregon. (Photo: Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian)Harding has grown used to visitors making unlikely pilgrimages to the store. “I get a lot of tour groups that come by, and ex-Blockbuster employees,” says Harding, 51. “A lady from Washington with a van load of beagles came, and lined them up, and took photos of the beagles. People come in from all over the world, and do podcasts. I’ve had people call me wanting to do a Blockbuster musical. We’re going to have a lot of stuff for our scrapbook someday.”Harding, who has worked at the Blockbuster outpost in Bend since 2004, has seen plenty of ups and downs at the store. In the pre-streaming era, Blockbuster video stores were everywhere. At the chain’s peak, there were about 9,000 stores operating, luring film fans, families and restless teenagers who turned up to rent popular movies, and stock up on candy.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTokBut, thanks to some misguided business decisions, and the increasing popularity of streaming services like Netflix, Blockbuster video stores started to disappear. When a pair of filmmakers set out to make a documentary about Blockbustervideo in 2017, they didn’t realize that, by March 2019, the Bend operation would be the last Blockbuster in the world.The fact that the sole Blockbuster left on the planet was located in Bend, a central Oregon city better known for its proximity to skiing and other outdoorsy pastimes, became national news. The Washington Post, ABC News, CNN, the Chicago Tribune, NBC News and many more outlets reported on the fact that the once-mighty Blockbuster brand now consisted of one store, owned by Ken and Debbie Tisher, who had started their Central Oregon video adventures in 1990 by opening the now-gone Pacific Video Store.NOSTALGIA’S STARRING ROLEThe store got even more exposure thanks to the 2020 documentary, “The Last Blockbuster,” from Bend-based filmmakers Taylor Morden and Zeke Kamm. The documentary is both a celebration of the Bend store’s survival, and a look at how the Blockbuster empire eventually crumbled, a fate that, according to the documentary, was a result of misguided management (including passing up an opportunity to purchase the then-new Netflix).Adding an extra layer of irony was the fact that “The Last Blockbuster” reached an even wider viewership once it began streaming on – you guessed it – Netflix.It’s that kind of attention that helps keep the lights on at the Bend Blockbuster, says Harding. “The main reason we’re here is because of nostalgia,” says Harding. “Although we do rent videos every day, it’s not enough.”A big driver of revenue, Harding says, is merchandise, much of it produced in collaboration with other locally based business. “Seventy to eighty percent of the business is the merchandise,” Harding says. Her mother, who is one of many of Harding’s family members who have helped keep the Blockbuster going, is busy this Friday in a nearby space that’s used for the mail-order and merchandise part of the business. Boxes of T-shirts and sweatshirts are piled high.Merchandise for sale at the last Blockbuster video store on earth, in Bend, Oregon.Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian“Our most popular item is our trucker hats,” Harding says, but other items boasting the familiar Blockbuster designs include a fanny pack, mugs, socks, keychains, ornaments, sunglasses, tote bags, posters, and more.CREATIVITY IS KEYThe COVID-19 pandemic also forced the Bend Blockbuster to come up with ideas to keep the store operating, at a time when businesses depending on in-person patrons were suffering. “Our rental business was cut in half overnight,” Harding recalls. One example was a 2020 idea that made the Bend store available for overnight Airbnb stays, complete with retro-style details including vintage furniture and video games.Harding got the word out in appearances on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” and more. “That’s just how you have to get creative,” she says, a skill that Harding says is especially necessary for small-business owners.As customers begin to filter in on Friday morning, Harding and two of her 15-total staff members, answer a question about whether they’ve seen the Netflix series, “Blockbuster.” The 10-episode comedy, which began streaming Nov. 3, stars Randall Park as the owner of what’s supposedly the last Blockbuster video store standing. But the show is set in some town in Michigan, and nobody involved with the actual last Blockbuster in Bend had anything to do with the show.Harding says she hasn’t seen much of the Netflix show, adding that it reminded her of another workplace comedy, “Superstore.” She’s read a bit, she says, about how the show has been criticized for not being enough about Blockbuster stores.Dan Montgomery, the Bend Blockbuster manager, has worked at the store for 14 years. He agrees with Harding that the Netflix show passed up a fruitful opportunity for humor by not getting into the thorny topic of late fees -- something a recent Bend Blockbuster-inspired episode of Fox’s “Family Guy” didn’t shy away from at all.“We’ve had some wonderful experiences with late fees,” Montgomery, 37, says with a smile. The show could have also benefited from paying more attention to “what our day-to-day lives are like.” When it comes to his personal taste, Montgomery says, “I’m a big horror guy.”“These kids know more than I do about movies,” says Harding. “I don’t like dramas, and I do not like to cry.”Among the customers entering the store on Friday is Lily Liu, 60, of Happy Valley. She’s in the area, she says, because her husband is attending a work-related event. Liu and her son, Kenji Hasegawa, 13, decided to come to the Blockbuster store because, Liu says, “it’s the very last one.”The Bend Blockbuster video store includes display of some of the store staff's favorites.Kristi Turnquist/The OregonianHasegawa says this is the first time he’s been to a video store. Liu recalls how, when she used to live in Winnipeg, in Canada, “We had a Blockbuster.” Being from China, Liu says, renting movies from Blockbuster “helped me learn English.”Travis Bieghler, who has also worked off and on at the Bend Blockbuster for years, says he enjoys being part of the store crew, while he completes his master’s degree. “It’s worked out great,” says the 30-year-old. “Everyone who comes in here is happy, because it’s nostalgic. No one makes the trip here to be upset.”Despite contending with ‘90s-era technology inherited from the Blockbuster franchise days, and other challenges, Harding says it’s satisfying to keep the last Blockbuster going. “I feel like our local community is proud of what we’ve done.”As for why this Blockbuster has been able to hang on, Harding says it’s because of what the business represents. “I have Netflix and Amazon, and I understand the temptation of streaming something,” Harding says. But when you do that, “You’re definitely missing that social interaction. And everybody loves a movie, and being able to escape into it, and forget about the rest of the crazy world.”More of our coverage:‘Blockbuster’: The Netflix comedy isn’t about the Bend video store -- unfortunately— Kristi Turnquist503-221-8227; kturnquist@oregonian.com; @KristiturnquistOur journalism needs your support.

Trail Blazers broadcaster Evoca TV warns it will shut down without more funding ,Mike Rogoway,Business,"Nov. 30, 2022, 5:30 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 5:07 p.m.",100,"Evoca uses a streaming box based on Google's Android operating system. Subscriptions are $30 a month, including $5 to rent the box.Evoca TVNEW!100sharesBy Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLiveEvoca TV, an Idaho company that broadcasts local channels and pro sports in Portland and other western cities, warned Wednesday that it is running out of money and may shut down at the end of the year.That would shut off the cheapest option to see Portland Trail Blazers broadcasts.“This is a difficult economy for a company like ours to raise the funding that we need to grow,” Evoca wrote in a note to customers. “Should we be unable to raise more capital, we are sad to say that Evoca TV will discontinue operations and programming on December 31st, 2022.”Evoca said it won’t bill customers for their December service and won’t require them to return their equipment if the company does shut down. The company declined to say how much it has raised or how much it needs to continue operating. Evoca charges $30 a month for a package that includes local broadcast networks, some streaming channels and Root Sports -- a regional network that carries the Portland Trail Blazers, Seattle Mariners and Seattle Kraken. Evoca also operates in Idaho, Colorado, Arizona and Michigan, offering broadcasts carried in each local market.Root Sports is not available from the most popular streaming services. Those that do offer it charge upwards of $80 a month. That makes Evoca the most affordable option to the Trail Blazers on TV.Evoca has marketed its service heavily during Blazers broadcasts, pitching its service through commercials, on-court advertisements and free tickets to games. Its offerings are much more limited than other subscription TV services, though, and it’s unclear whether it’s targeting a market large enough to support the business.Venture capital investment in young companies is down sharply this year, reflecting greater pessimism about the global economic outlook. That’s led to layoffs and shutdowns at startups across the country.-- Mike Rogoway | mrogoway@oregonian.com | Twitter: @rogoway |If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",155,"'100sharesby':25 '2022':128 '30':15,175 '31st':127 '5':19 '80':240 'account':350 'across':333 'advertis':272 'afford':248 'also':207 'android':10 'arizona':212 'avail':225 'base':6 'bill':134 'blazer':76,200,253,262 'box':5 'box.evoca':23 'broadcast':35,77,184,216,263 'business.venture':305 'capit':111,306 'carri':196,217 'channel':37,188 'charg':174,237 'cheapest':70 'citi':46 'colorado':211 'commerci':268 'compani':33,85,151,156,310 'compens':362 'continu':171 'countri':335 'court':271 'custom':103,135 'decemb':126,138 'declin':157 'difficult':81 'discontinu':121 'econom':322 'economi':82 'end':62 'enough':301 'equip':148 'evoca':1,97,118,129,173,206,245 'free':274 'fund':91 'game':277 'global':321 'googl':8 'greater':317 'grow':96 'heavili':260 'idaho':32,210 'includ':18,182 'invest':307 'kraken':205 'larg':300 'layoff':328 'led':326 'like':86 'limit':283 'link':355 'local':36,183,220 'make':244 'marin':202 'market':257,299 'market.root':221 'may':57,360 'michigan':214 'mike':26,336 'money':55 'month':17,177,242 'mrogoway@oregonian.com':338 'much':161,167,281 'need':94,169 'network':185,194 'note':101 'offer':215,235,279 'on-court':269 'one':352 'oper':11,122,172,208 'option':71,249 'oregonian/oregonliveevoca':29 'outlook':323 'packag':180 'pessim':318 'pitch':264 'popular':229 'portland':42,74,198 'pro':39 'product':345 'program':124 'purchas':343 'rais':89,109,164 'receiv':361 'reflect':316 'region':193 'regist':347 'rent':21 'requir':143 'return':146 'rogoway':27,337,340 'root':190 'run':52 'sad':114 'said':130 'say':116,159 'seattl':201,204 'see':73 'servic':139,231,259,266,288 'sharpli':313 'shut':58,67,153 'shutdown':330 'site':358 'sport':40,191,222 'startup':332 'stream':4,187,230 'subscript':13,286 'support':303 'system':12 'target':297 'though':289 'ticket':275 'trail':75,199,252 'tv':30,119,287 'tv.evoca':255 'tvnew':24 'twitter':339 'unabl':107 'unclear':293 'upward':238 'use':2 'warn':47 'wednesday':48 'western':45 'whether':294 'won':132,141 'would':66 'wrote':98 'year':315 'year.that':65 'young':309","{""The Oregonian""}"
"The last Blockbuster video store in Bend inspires a Netflix show, nostalgia-loving customers, and more",Kristi Turnquist,Life & Culture,"Dec. 02, 2022, 9:56 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 7:59 a.m.",239,"Sandi Harding is the general manager of the last Blockbuster video store on the planet, located in Bend, Oregon. (Photo: Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian)NEW!239sharesBy Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIt’s been the subject of numerous news stories, received national TV exposure, and helped inspire a Netflix comedy series. But business goes on as usual at the Bend Blockbuster.Of course, as the last Blockbuster video rental store on the planet, that business includes watching tourists taking photos outside, taking care of visitors who stock up on merchandise inside, and dealing with the occasional couple planning to get married in the middle of the store.On an October Friday morning, general manager Sandi Harding is pushing a rolling cart loaded with Blockbuster-blue sweatpants toward the store’s entry, near a “Be Kind. Please Rewind” sign. The store hasn’t opened yet, but there’s already activity in the parking lot of the modest strip mall where the last Blockbuster on the planet is located. A van with Washington state plates pulls up, and a woman gets out to snap a photo on her phone of the store’s exterior, with its distinctive yellow-and-blue signage.The last Blockbuster video store on the planet is in Bend, Oregon. (Photo: Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian)Harding has grown used to visitors making unlikely pilgrimages to the store. “I get a lot of tour groups that come by, and ex-Blockbuster employees,” says Harding, 51. “A lady from Washington with a van load of beagles came, and lined them up, and took photos of the beagles. People come in from all over the world, and do podcasts. I’ve had people call me wanting to do a Blockbuster musical. We’re going to have a lot of stuff for our scrapbook someday.”Harding, who has worked at the Blockbuster outpost in Bend since 2004, has seen plenty of ups and downs at the store. In the pre-streaming era, Blockbuster video stores were everywhere. At the chain’s peak, there were about 9,000 stores operating, luring film fans, families and restless teenagers who turned up to rent popular movies, and stock up on candy.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTokBut, thanks to some misguided business decisions, and the increasing popularity of streaming services like Netflix, Blockbuster video stores started to disappear. When a pair of filmmakers set out to make a documentary about Blockbustervideo in 2017, they didn’t realize that, by March 2019, the Bend operation would be the last Blockbuster in the world.The fact that the sole Blockbuster left on the planet was located in Bend, a central Oregon city better known for its proximity to skiing and other outdoorsy pastimes, became national news. The Washington Post, ABC News, CNN, the Chicago Tribune, NBC News and many more outlets reported on the fact that the once-mighty Blockbuster brand now consisted of one store, owned by Ken and Debbie Tisher, who had started their Central Oregon video adventures in 1990 by opening the now-gone Pacific Video Store.NOSTALGIA’S STARRING ROLEThe store got even more exposure thanks to the 2020 documentary, “The Last Blockbuster,” from Bend-based filmmakers Taylor Morden and Zeke Kamm. The documentary is both a celebration of the Bend store’s survival, and a look at how the Blockbuster empire eventually crumbled, a fate that, according to the documentary, was a result of misguided management (including passing up an opportunity to purchase the then-new Netflix).Adding an extra layer of irony was the fact that “The Last Blockbuster” reached an even wider viewership once it began streaming on – you guessed it – Netflix.It’s that kind of attention that helps keep the lights on at the Bend Blockbuster, says Harding. “The main reason we’re here is because of nostalgia,” says Harding. “Although we do rent videos every day, it’s not enough.”A big driver of revenue, Harding says, is merchandise, much of it produced in collaboration with other locally based business. “Seventy to eighty percent of the business is the merchandise,” Harding says. Her mother, who is one of many of Harding’s family members who have helped keep the Blockbuster going, is busy this Friday in a nearby space that’s used for the mail-order and merchandise part of the business. Boxes of T-shirts and sweatshirts are piled high.Merchandise for sale at the last Blockbuster video store on earth, in Bend, Oregon.Kristi Turnquist/The Oregonian“Our most popular item is our trucker hats,” Harding says, but other items boasting the familiar Blockbuster designs include a fanny pack, mugs, socks, keychains, ornaments, sunglasses, tote bags, posters, and more.CREATIVITY IS KEYThe COVID-19 pandemic also forced the Bend Blockbuster to come up with ideas to keep the store operating, at a time when businesses depending on in-person patrons were suffering. “Our rental business was cut in half overnight,” Harding recalls. One example was a 2020 idea that made the Bend store available for overnight Airbnb stays, complete with retro-style details including vintage furniture and video games.Harding got the word out in appearances on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” and more. “That’s just how you have to get creative,” she says, a skill that Harding says is especially necessary for small-business owners.As customers begin to filter in on Friday morning, Harding and two of her 15-total staff members, answer a question about whether they’ve seen the Netflix series, “Blockbuster.” The 10-episode comedy, which began streaming Nov. 3, stars Randall Park as the owner of what’s supposedly the last Blockbuster video store standing. But the show is set in some town in Michigan, and nobody involved with the actual last Blockbuster in Bend had anything to do with the show.Harding says she hasn’t seen much of the Netflix show, adding that it reminded her of another workplace comedy, “Superstore.” She’s read a bit, she says, about how the show has been criticized for not being enough about Blockbuster stores.Dan Montgomery, the Bend Blockbuster manager, has worked at the store for 14 years. He agrees with Harding that the Netflix show passed up a fruitful opportunity for humor by not getting into the thorny topic of late fees -- something a recent Bend Blockbuster-inspired episode of Fox’s “Family Guy” didn’t shy away from at all.“We’ve had some wonderful experiences with late fees,” Montgomery, 37, says with a smile. The show could have also benefited from paying more attention to “what our day-to-day lives are like.” When it comes to his personal taste, Montgomery says, “I’m a big horror guy.”“These kids know more than I do about movies,” says Harding. “I don’t like dramas, and I do not like to cry.”Among the customers entering the store on Friday is Lily Liu, 60, of Happy Valley. She’s in the area, she says, because her husband is attending a work-related event. Liu and her son, Kenji Hasegawa, 13, decided to come to the Blockbuster store because, Liu says, “it’s the very last one.”The Bend Blockbuster video store includes display of some of the store staff's favorites.Kristi Turnquist/The OregonianHasegawa says this is the first time he’s been to a video store. Liu recalls how, when she used to live in Winnipeg, in Canada, “We had a Blockbuster.” Being from China, Liu says, renting movies from Blockbuster “helped me learn English.”Travis Bieghler, who has also worked off and on at the Bend Blockbuster for years, says he enjoys being part of the store crew, while he completes his master’s degree. “It’s worked out great,” says the 30-year-old. “Everyone who comes in here is happy, because it’s nostalgic. No one makes the trip here to be upset.”Despite contending with ‘90s-era technology inherited from the Blockbuster franchise days, and other challenges, Harding says it’s satisfying to keep the last Blockbuster going. “I feel like our local community is proud of what we’ve done.”As for why this Blockbuster has been able to hang on, Harding says it’s because of what the business represents. “I have Netflix and Amazon, and I understand the temptation of streaming something,” Harding says. But when you do that, “You’re definitely missing that social interaction. And everybody loves a movie, and being able to escape into it, and forget about the rest of the crazy world.”More of our coverage:‘Blockbuster’: The Netflix comedy isn’t about the Bend video store -- unfortunately— Kristi Turnquist503-221-8227; kturnquist@oregonian.com; @KristiturnquistOur journalism needs your support.

‘Mixed emotions’: Portland preschool faces closure as church repurposes land to house Indigenous families,Rose Wong,Education,"Dec. 02, 2022, 5:42 p.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",291,"Teacher Annette said a large space allows children to explore and become independent learners. ""We've grown to realize having a large outdoor space is pretty magical for kids,"" she said.NEW!291sharesBy Rose Wong | The Oregonian/OregonLiveAfter 25 years of operating in the Presbyterian Church of Laurelhurst, Portland Tillamook Preschool must find a new location by next summer or face closure.Presbytery of the Cascades, a governing body of more than 90 congregations including the Laurelhurst one, informed the preschool in October that it will terminate its lease a year earlier than scheduled. The school will need to vacate the Northeast Portland church building on Northeast 33rd Avenue south of Sandy Boulevard by the end of June.“We regret that we could not continue to maintain the lease for the full five years … but we are now making new commitments to the site and needed to make use of our ‘termination at will’ option in the lease agreement,” said Brian Heron, executive presbyter of the Presbytery of the Cascades.The Presbytery intends to repurpose the land where the church stands into a tiny home village for Indigenous single parents and children. The collaboration with three other entities — Indigenous organization Future Generations Collaborative, affordable housing group Leaven Community Land and Housing Coalition and Westminster Presbytery Church. That may eventually result in the local Indigenous community assuming ownership of the land, as part of the national Land Back movement that advocates for returning land to Indigenous people, Heron said.The Presbytery is also looking for new uses for three of its other properties where congregations have closed, including nine acres in Beaverton that will become affordable housing.“I have such mixed emotions,” said Anna Lagasse, board president of Tillamook Preschool. “I’m feeling responsible for finding this school a new location, but also I think what the church is doing is wonderful.”Lagasse’s 5-year-old son, Grayson, attends the cooperative preschool, a not-for-profit organization run by parents who sign up for responsibilities at the start of the academic year. Parents may be in charge of building maintenance, laundry or administrative work. The school has 38 children split between two classes that meet on alternate days of the week. Classes are run by a teacher, the school’s only paid employee, with the help of at least three parents.While the lease ends in June, registration for the next school year begins in January. The school typically hosts an open house for prospective students and families after the New Year.“It’s hard to draw new families in without a location,” Lagasse said.Preschool allows children to develop social-emotional skills and adjust to environments outside of the home when their brains are most elastic, ensuring that they arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. Extensive research has shown children who attend high-quality preschools experience better social, health and economic outcomes later in life.Working families also rely on preschools for childcare. A 2021 Oregon State University study showed that more than half of Multnomah County’s preschool-aged children did not have access to childcare slots before the pandemic. Every county in the state was designated as a childcare desert for children between ages 0 and 2, meaning 70% of children did not have access to childcare slots, the report found.During the pandemic, Multnomah County lost 300, or a fifth, of its childcare providers, according to the county, putting added strain on families looking for quality childcare options.In its current location, Tillamook Preschool has access to a building with ample natural light, an indoor gym and a large outdoor space with a playground — ideal for a play-based school that encourages creativity and independence through the use of open space, Lagasse said.The church has also offered affordable rent that’s inaccessible in most of Portland, she added. Finding a new, affordable home will be a challenge. Lagasse said they need a minimum of 1,300 square feet of ground-floor classroom space with adequate windows and direct access to an outdoor playground. She said they are asking members of the community to reach out with any leads.Annette Horten has worked for Tillamook Preschool and been known by children and parents as Teacher Annette for 20 years. She said parents whose children have finished preschool years ago still keep in touch.Whatever happens to Tillamook, Horten said she will remain an educator. But she said she’s not thinking about her Plan B right now. She is more concerned about what it would mean for the curious, free-roaming preschoolers that rely on the school if it isn’t able to find a new space that fits their needs.“I’ve always considered this space like a second teacher,” she said.-- Rose Wong covers early childhood education for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Rubik gives clues to solving cube he invented: watch a robot crack the code,The Associated Press,Life & Culture,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 6:23 a.m.",0,"FILE - Professor Ern? Rubik, inventor of Rubik's Cube, is photographed in New York on Sept. 18, 2018. Rubik has seen his color-matching puzzle go from a classroom teaching tool in Cold War-era Hungary to a worldwide phenomenon with over 450 million cubes sold and a mini-empire of related toys. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)APNEW!By The Associated PressIf you’ve ever had trouble solving a Rubik’s Cube, a good piece of advice is to break it down into steps. It’s worth a shot: That advice is from the man who invented it.“Problem solving is a very basic activity of the human mind and if a problem is complex you need to divide the problem into smaller elements,” says Ern? Rubik, who invented the cube in 1974.Rubik has seen his color-matching puzzle go from a classroom teaching tool in Cold War-era Hungary to a worldwide phenomenon with over 450 million cubes sold and a mini-empire of related toys.“For me, the cube represents what freedom means. Freedom is never endless,” he said during a recent visit to New York. “It lets you do what is necessary to achieve your goal.”The original 3x3 Rubik’s has more than 43 quintillion — that’s more than 43,000,000,000,000,000,000 — possible configurations, but the principles behind the cube have been refashioned for 2x2, 4x4 and 5x5 cubes, a board game called Rubik’s Race, a pyramid, a tower and a Christmas tree, among others.It even made the transition to electronic media with Rubik’s Revolution and Rubik’s Touch. Spin Master acquired the brand in 2021. Their latest brainteaser is called the Phantom, which takes the 3x3 original cube and adds a memory test: Using thermochromic technology, the multi-color tiles revert to black unless the heat of the user’s hand keeps them visible.“The principle of the cube is not limited,” says Rubik. “The complexity of the task is to stimulate our mind and it makes it a much more enjoyable activity.”The goal of all Rubik puzzles is to start with some randomized and shuffled messy configuration and, by rotating faces or parts, transform each side into a single color or a pattern of colors.Practiced cube-solvers can complete the Rubik’s Cube in a matter of seconds, with the current world-record holder solving a cube in 3.47 seconds. There are also records at the World Cube Association for fastest solving while wearing a blindfold or using one hand.It took 36 years after the invention of the toy for anyone to come up with an answer for the minimum number of moves to solve it. In 2010, a group of mathematicians and computer programmers proved that any Rubik’s Cube can be solved in 20 moves.Rubik was a budding artist who hoped to become a sculptor or a painter before he studied architecture, which he argues is art with a function: “Architecture is changing the environment according to our needs.”He got a degree in architecture at Budapest University of Technology and became a teacher in the interior design department at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest.Rubik regularly used physical models and materials to teach concepts in construction and design.“As our body needs some kind of exercises, the brain needs that kind of exercise as well,” he says. Thus was born an elegant teaching tool he named “The Magic Cube.”“I tried to make it as simple as possible because I thought the task itself is complicated enough,” he says. “You don’t need to complicate anymore.”The puzzle — which uses rounded elements for the center core — is easy to use, but also hard enough to solve that more than one cuber has thrown it across a room in frustration.“One of the main keys of the cube is the contradiction between complexity and simplicity,” Rubik says. “On one hand, the cube is a very simple form. And on the other hand, the potential of the variation of movement is so complicated.”The brain-bending elegance of the Rubik’s Cube is part of the reason it has endured, while other faddish toys and games — Tamagotchi or Shopkins, anyone? — have not.“Usually these kinds of crazes are ending very soon,” Rubik says. “But the cube didn’t die.”In 2014, it landed in the National Toy Hall of Fame, joining such childhood classics as Barbie, Hot Wheels, G.I. Joe and the hula hoop. The hall noted that the cube has caused its own medical condition, known as “cube’s thumb” or “Rubik’s wrist.” The cube has also show up in TV shows and movies from “The Simpsons” to “The Pursuit of Happyness.”Rubik recalls the early days when some people were convinced the cube was impossible to solve. He knew it could be done and was asked to prove it.“I tried to explain and show people it is possible and if something is possible for me, you can do it yourself,” he says. “It’s a very nice proof of the power of science.”If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",169,"'000':221,222,223,224,225,226 '18':17 '1974.rubik':136 '20':478 '2010':460 '2014':738 '2018':18 '2021':282 '2x2':239 '3.47':411 '36':434 '3x3':208,293 '43':214,220 '450':45,162 '4x4':240 '5x5':242 'academi':536 'accord':510 'account':874 'achiev':203 'acquir':278 'across':643 'activ':108,351 'add':297 'advic':80,94 'also':415,630,786 'among':259 'answer':449 'anymor':614 'anyon':443,717 'ap':57 'apnew':61 'appli':538 'architectur':496,505,519 'argu':499 'art':501,539 'artist':483 'ask':826 'associ':64,421 'barbi':753 'basic':107 'becam':526 'becom':487 'behind':232 'bend':693 'black':311 'blindfold':428 'board':245 'bodi':559 'born':578 'brain':566,692 'brain-bend':691 'brainteas':285 'brand':280 'break':83 'bud':482 'budapest':521 'budapest.rubik':543 'call':247,287 'caus':769 'center':623 'chang':507 'childhood':750 'christma':257 'classic':751 'classroom':30,147 'cold':34,151 'color':24,141,307,380 'color-match':23,140 'colors.practiced':385 'come':445 'compens':886 'complet':390 'complex':118,334,660 'complic':604,613,689 'comput':466 'concept':552 'condit':773 'configur':228,367 'construct':554 'contradict':658 'convinc':811 'core':624 'could':821 'craft':541 'craze':724 'cube':9,47,75,134,164,177,234,243,295,327,387,394,409,420,473,587,655,669,699,733,767,776,784,813 'cube-solv':386 'cuber':639 'current':402 'day':806 'degre':517 'depart':533 'design':532,556 'didn':734 'die':736 'divid':122 'done':823 'drew':59 'earli':805 'easi':626 'electron':266 'eleg':580,694 'element':127,620 'empir':53,170 'end':726 'endless':185 'endur':707 'enjoy':350 'enough':605,632 'environ':509 'era':37,154 'ern':3,129 'even':261 'ever':68 'exercis':564,571 'explain':833 'face':371 'faddish':710 'fame':747 'fastest':423 'file':1,60 'form':674 'freedom':180,182 'frustrat':647 'function':504 'g.i':756 'game':246,713 'go':27,144 'goal':205,353 'good':77 'got':515 'group':462 'hall':745,763 'hand':319,667,679 'hand.it':432 'happy':801 'hard':631 'heat':314 'holder':406 'hoop':761 'hope':485 'hot':754 'hula':760 'human':111 'hungari':38,155 'imposs':815 'interior':531 'invent':100,132,438 'inventor':5 'joe':757 'join':748 'keep':320 'key':652 'kind':562,569,722 'knew':819 'known':774 'land':740 'latest':284 'let':196 'limit':330 'link':879 'made':262 'magic':586 'main':651 'make':345,591 'man':98 'master':277 'match':25,142 'materi':549 'mathematician':464 'matter':397 'may':884 'mean':181 'media':267 'medic':772 'memori':299 'messi':366 'million':46,163 'mind':112,342 'mini':52,169 'mini-empir':51,168 'minimum':452 'model':547 'move':455 'movement':686 'moves.rubik':479 'movi':793 'much':348 'multi':306 'multi-color':305 'name':584 'nation':743 'necessari':201 'need':120,513,560,567,611 'never':184 'new':13,193 'nice':858 'note':764 'number':453 'one':431,638,648,666,876 'origin':207,294 'others.it':260 'painter':492 'part':373,701 'pattern':383 'peopl':809,836 'phantom':289 'phenomenon':42,159 'photo/richard':58 'photograph':11 'physic':546 'piec':78 'possibl':227,596,839,844 'potenti':681 'power':862 'pressif':65 'principl':231,324 'problem':102,116,124 'product':869 'professor':2 'programm':467 'proof':859 'prove':468,828 'purchas':867 'pursuit':799 'puzzl':26,143,357,616 'pyramid':252 'quintillion':215 'race':250 'random':363 'reason':704 'recal':803 'receiv':885 'recent':190 'record':405,416 'refashion':237 'regist':871 'regular':544 'relat':55,172 'repres':178 'revert':309 'revolut':271 'room':645 'rotat':370 'round':619 'rubik':4,7,19,73,130,209,248,269,273,332,356,392,471,663,697,729,780,802 'said':187 'say':128,331,575,607,664,730,853 'scienc':864 'sculptor':489 'second':399,412 'seen':21,138 'sept':16 'shopkin':716 'shot':92 'show':787,791,835 'shuffl':365 'side':376 'simpl':594,673 'simplic':662 'simpson':796 'singl':379 'site':882 'smaller':126 'sold':48,165 'solv':71,103,407,424,457,476,634,817 'solver':388 'someth':842 'soon':728 'spin':276 'start':360 'step':87 'stimul':340 'studi':495 'take':291 'tamagotchi':714 'task':337,601 'teach':31,148,551,581 'teacher':528 'technolog':303,524 'test':300 'thermochrom':302 'thought':599 'thrown':641 'thumb':778 'thus':576 'tile':308 'took':433 'tool':32,149,582 'touch':275 'tower':254 'toy':56,173,441,711,744 'transform':374 'transit':264 'tree':258 'tri':589,831 'troubl':70 'tv':790 'univers':522 'unless':312 'use':301,430,545,618,628 'user':317 'usual':720 'variat':684 've':67 'visibl':322 'visit':191 'war':36,153 'war-era':35,152 'wear':426 'well':573 'wheel':755 'world':404,419 'world-record':403 'worldwid':41,158 'worth':90 'wrist':782 'year':435 'york':14,194",

They stood, cheered and chanted, “Gary, Gary, Gary,” during the revealing of the banner.“It’s huge,” Payton said after the ceremony held during halftime of a Bruins game. “Those guys, since I’ve been here, we have a tight little brotherhood. Those are my guys. They ride for me and I just can’t wait to get on the court and return the favor.”Speaking of that. Will Payton, who has yet to play this season while recovering from offseason core muscle surgery, be available soon?“Yeah, I’ll be back, soon,” Payton said with a smile. “Week by week. Check the ticker.”Given that Payton, signed as a free agent last summer, hasn’t played a minute with his new teammates, the bond that already exists is indicative of the team’s tightness.“This is the type of chemistry and camaraderie that good teams have,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “All of these guys were the best player from where they came from. So, it’s an honor to support him. It’s an off day for us and his family is here. I think it’s great.”The Trail Blazers cheer while Salt Lake CC retires the jersey number of Gary Payton II during a ceremony Friday night. #ripcity pic.twitter.com/2f9HlZn9sN— Aaron J.

They practiced briefly shortly after arriving in Salt Lake City Friday afternoon then headed to the SLCC.“Everybody has their own journey,” Billups said. “I’m pretty sure when he first came here he probably imagined he would be somewhere else. It’s funny how things happen.”Payton, the son of NBA legend Gary Payton, attended SLCC in order to get his grades up in order to qualify for a Division I scholarship. While doing so, he helped lead the Bruins to two successful seasons before moving on to Oregon State.Even though his play at SLCC propelled him to the Pac-12, Payton said he was shocked to be so revered.“I honestly didn’t think I was playing that well here when I was here,” Payton said. “To be put in the rafters, it was as dope experience.”-- Aaron Fentress reported from Salt Lake City, Utah.-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook).

Rural Oregon town rejected a preschool for years. Now parents embrace its expansion,Rose Wong,Education,"Nov. 20, 2022, 4:36 p.m.","Nov. 20, 2022, 8:00 a.m.",205,"Children at the public preschool in Yoncalla, a rural town 45 miles south of Eugene, revel in playing with fall leaves. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)NEW!205sharesBy Rose Wong | The Oregonian/OregonLiveDays before Halloween, children at Yoncalla Preschool gathered around a table displaying images of loved ones who had passed away, some shown in framed photos, some hand-drawn: Delanee’s grandma wearing a Santa hat, Brooklynn’s grandpa holding her on his lap, Jayah’s pug named Romeo.The class was celebrating Día de los Muertos, a Mexican holiday traditionally observed in early November to honor the dead.Every year, at least one preschooler in the rural small town loses a family member. Megan Barber, the preschool’s director and head teacher, needed a way to help the 3- and 4-year-olds talk about grief. Cut-out paper hearts that students had decorated leaned against images of lost loved ones, and purple yarn hung from each of the hearts. Barber explained to students that “a heartstring” connects them with their loved ones even after they die, the same string that connects them with their parents when they’re at school and “connects you with me when you’re home.”“We’re recognizing we can be sad but also move on and experience joy in life,” Barber said.In the preschool classroom next door, teacher Jill Wells introduced the day’s storytime book: “The Day of the Dead/El Día de los Muertos: A Bilingual Celebration.” Wells read the English pages while Flor Rivera, an instructional assistant from El Salvador, read the Spanish translation.The preschool, free for any 3- or 4-year old in the district, aims to help children develop confidence and emotional regulation, along with knowledge of letters, numbers and the water cycle. Teachers and parents say preschoolers who take part arrive at kindergarten primed for success.But the preschool’s existence was anything but a given 10 years ago, when Portland-area do-gooders proposed it – and the townsfolk balked.Located 45 miles south of Eugene, Yoncalla has just over 1,000 people and a square-mile of city proper. Most families who have lived in Yoncalla for generations have felt the punch of poverty and unemployment, dating back to at least 1990, when logging and mill jobs had dried up in much of rural Oregon. These days, many Yoncallans commute to larger nearby cities to work in manufacturing, retail or health care.The school district is the town’s biggest employer. But most teachers and administrators live 30 to 40 miles outside the town, while locals tend to work as substitute teachers and classroom assistants.In 2012, a Portland-based nonprofit, the Children’s Institute, tried to help the school district open a public preschool. The idea was simple: A child’s brain creates millions of synapses per second, completing 90% of its growth by age 5. Waiting until kindergarten to boost children’s brain power makes little sense. Extensive research has shown children who receive high-quality early education experience better social, health and economic outcomes later in life.Families in a low-income neighborhood in east Portland had embraced that idea, welcoming the Children’s Institute’s help to open a preschool at their local elementary school.But the child advocacy nonprofit soon realized that Yoncalla was too apprehensive about its school district to hand over their 3- and 4-year-olds four days a week.For years, families distrusted the district, which scorned community involvement, suffered from rampant teacher turnover and consistently produced poor student outcomes, parents told The Oregonian/OregonLive this fall.“School looked like a zoo,” said parent Trinity Akins, whose six children are or have been students in the district.When a child advocacy nonprofit first tried to start a free preschool at Yoncalla Elementary, they soon realized Yoncalla was too apprehensive about its school district to hand over their 3- and 4-year-olds four days a week. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)For a pre-kindergarten program to be successful, Children’s Institute leaders realized, public opinion had to change.“We have a lot of people that are really poor and come from families with complexities,” said Erin Helgren, principal of Yoncalla Elementary who is also on staff at the Children’s Institute. “They were treated poorly in school, and they didn’t have the expectations that their own child’s needs would be met.”Parents had also been let down by organizations or businesses that tried to introduce early education programs in Yoncalla that were short-lived or largely served families from surrounding towns.In response to families’ negative feedback about a preschool launch, organizers pivoted to building trust with Yoncalla families. District and Children’s Institute leaders organized regular kindergarten readiness workshops at the local library, inviting experts to discuss social-emotional learning, best practices for reading to children and other ways to prepare their little ones for kindergarten. They served dinners to families who took part.Organizers also welcomed families to share what they would like a community preschool to look like. Parents asked for bus transportation, slots for families who didn’t quite qualify as low-income and the ability to visit children during school hours. Sure thing, district leaders said.By 2015, after three years of community-building efforts, the district felt it had garnered enough support.Yoncalla Preschool opened that fall with 22 children, using a classroom off an atrium connected to the elementary school. Through its Preschool Promise program, the state paid for 19 slots. The school district, the Children’s Institute and southern Oregon-based Ford Family Foundation paid for three more to serve children from families who earned too much to qualify for Preschool Promise. The state program, launched six years ago, serves families earning up to twice the federal poverty rate.Barber visited incoming preschoolers’ homes before the start of the school year to get to know families and talk through their concerns. Those visits allowed children to build trust with Barber before the first day of school, which helped ease their transition into a new environment. Throughout the school year, she continued to encourage family involvement through class dinners, open houses and parent volunteer opportunities in their child’s classroom.While Yoncalla Preschool exposes children to math and reading, Barber said, its core mission is to help students arrive at elementary school equipped for learning. That means helping them develop self-confidence, self-discipline and skills for resolving conflict and regulating negative emotions.The one-room preschool became so popular that, four years later, a second classroom opened. The two classes now have 18 children each, led by a teacher and two instructional assistants.The district plans to add a third classroom to meet student demand, Barber said.Yoncalla parents today speak proudly of their local preschool. Samantha Short said pre-kindergarten gave her 7-year-old son, Jaxxon, a love for learning that has followed him into first grade.“He would jump and wave all the way onto the bus,” she said, “and when he couldn’t go to school because he was sick or had other stuff to do, his little heart would be completely broken.”Yoncalla Preschool exposes 3- and 4-year-olds to early literacy and math skills. But at its heart, it aims to instill confidence, emotional self-regulation and similar skills that help children thrive as learners in elementary school. (Elizabeth Castillo-Salazar for The Oregonian/OregonLive)Preschool also helped Jaxxon correct a speech impediment. As a preschooler, her son was often frustrated because people could not understand him, Short said. After Barber recommended Jaxxon be evaluated for a language delay, he started receiving small-group speech therapy several hours a week. As he became more easily understood by others, he became more confident. “You could just see something clicked for him,” Short said.Six of this year’s preschoolers are receiving speech therapy, while 11 others are being evaluated. Completing speech therapy in preschool allows students to enter kindergarten ready to learn, Barber said.The preschool uses HighScope, a play-based curriculum that promotes creativity and independence, and Conscious Discipline, a set of instructional materials and strategies for social-emotional learning.When conflict occurs, Barber rolls out the “Time Machine:” Two students stand on opposite ends of a long mat, moving towards the center as they complete each step of conflict resolution written on the mat. The teacher stands between the children to facilitate the dialogue, starting by asking “are you willing” to set aside ego and listen to the other person.“Our kids are having better coping skills than adults,” said Madison Kokos, mom of two children who have attended the preschool. “They are teaching us.”Ninety percent of Yoncalla kindergarteners come through the preschool. Elementary school teacher Carol Robins said students who attend the preschool typically learn faster and get along better with their peers than those who do not.“When kids from the preschool come to kindergarten,” she said, “they are ready to learn.”Short’s 7- and 5-year-olds both attended Yoncalla Preschool. Her youngest, 3-year-old Bobbi, watched her older brother and sister ride off on the yellow school bus and come home with crafts they made. The siblings would show off new songs or a breathing exercise they learned.Bobbi starts preschool next year but she cannot seem to wait until then.“She asks me everyday,” Short said, “when is it my turn to go to school?”-- Rose Wong covers early childhood education for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

"Multnomah County officials want you to wear a face mask to slow spread of respiratory viruses, relieve hospital crowding",Fedor Zarkhin,Coronavirus,"Dec. 03, 2022, 9:00 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 5:08 p.m.",615,"Randall Children's Hospital in North Portland.NEW!615sharesBy Fedor Zarkhin | The Oregonian/OregonLiveMultnomah County and hospital officials are urging people to immediately take steps to stem the tide of respiratory virus infections that are causing “historical” levels of pressure on the local health care system, including by voluntarily wearing facial coverings through year’s end.At issue is a confluence of factors several years in the making, including a general shortage of hospital staff and Oregonians’ weakened protections from influenza and RSV due to two years of isolation because of COVID-19. As a result, the tri-county area has seen the highest pediatric hospitalization numbers for RSV during the five years the state has tracked those numbers, even as the flu season is ratcheting up fast. On top of that, COVID-19 hospitalizations have climbed far more than was previously expected, further straining the health care system.“We’ve used the word ‘unprecedented’ a lot in the last three years,” Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Vines said at a press briefing Thursday. “So it’s hard to know how to ratchet that up. We are at what our people are calling a historical moment.”The strain has hit children’s hospitals especially hard, in large part because of cases of RSV, a common virus that can be particularly dangerous to kids under five. All three of Oregon’s hospitals with pediatric intensive care beds recently switched to “crisis standards of care,” which allows them to assign more patients per staff member.The crisis standards also would allow the hospitals to ration care, though hospital representatives who joined Vines on the call said they are not doing so and hope they won’t have to.“We are going to continue to stretch and continue to stretch to do everything we can to meet the needs of the kids who really need our care,” said Dr. Carl Eriksson, a Doernbecher pediatric specialist. “We’re working very hard, but we’re not there yet.”RSV hospitalizations have either peaked or will peak soon, according to an Oregon Health & Science University forecast.Asked to elaborate whether the county and its hospitals expect to reach a point when they do have to ration care, Vines said this risk is “not our message today” and that the steps people can take to prevent that outcome is.To stem the tide of respiratory virus infections and hospitalizations, Vines asked for a “personal, voluntary action” for everyone to wear a mask while indoors at least until Jan. 1, urged people to get vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19, wash their hands and stay home if they are sick.— Fedor ZarkhinIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",195,"'-19':90,132,428 '1':418 '615sharesby':8 'accord':341 'account':449 'action':405 'allow':244,257 'also':255 'area':98 'ask':400 'assign':247 'bed':235 'brief':172 'call':192,271 'care':43,146,234,242,262,312,368 'carl':315 'case':210 'caus':34 'children':2,200 'climb':135 'common':214 'compens':461 'confluenc':58 'continu':289,293 'counti':13,97,162,353 'cover':50 'covid':89,131,427 'crisi':239,253 'danger':220 'doernbech':318 'dr':165,314 'due':81 'either':335 'elabor':350 'end.at':54 'eriksson':316 'especi':203 'even':118 'everyon':407 'everyth':298 'expect':141,357 'facial':49 'factor':60 'far':136 'fast':126 'fedor':9,439 'five':110,224 'flu':121 'forecast.asked':348 'general':68 'get':422 'go':287 'hand':431 'hard':177,204,325 'health':42,145,163,345 'highest':102 'histor':35,194 'hit':199 'home':434 'hope':279 'hospit':4,15,71,104,133,202,230,259,264,333,356,398 'immedi':21 'includ':45,66 'indoor':413 'infect':31,396 'influenza':78,425 'intens':233 'is.to':389 'isol':86 'issu':55 'jan':417 'jennif':166 'join':267 'kid':222,307 'know':179 'larg':206 'last':158 'least':415 'level':36 'link':454 'local':41 'lot':155 'make':65 'mask':411 'may':459 'meet':302 'member.the':252 'messag':376 'moment':195 'multnomah':161 'need':304,310 'north':6 'number':105,117 'offic':164 'offici':16 'one':451 'oregon':228,344 'oregonian':74 'oregonian/oregonlivemultnomah':12 'outcom':388 'part':207 'particular':219 'patient':249 'peak':336,339 'pediatr':103,232,319 'peopl':19,190,382,420 'per':250 'person':403 'point':361 'portland.new':7 'press':171 'pressur':38 'prevent':386 'previous':140 'product':444 'protect':76 'purchas':442 'randal':1 'ratchet':124,182 'ration':261,367 're':322,328 'reach':359 'realli':309 'receiv':460 'recent':236 'regist':446 'repres':265 'respiratori':29,394 'result':93 'risk':372 'rsv':80,107,212,332 'said':168,272,313,370 'scienc':346 'season':122 'seen':100 'sever':61 'shortag':69 'sick':438 'site':457 'soon':340 'specialist':320 'staff':72,251 'standard':240,254 'state':113 'stay':433 'stem':25,390 'step':23,381 'strain':143,197 'stretch':291,295 'switch':237 'system':44,147 'take':22,384 'though':263 'three':159,226 'thursday':173 'tide':27,392 'today':377 'top':128 'track':115 'tri':96 'tri-counti':95 'two':83 'univers':347 'unpreced':153 'urg':18,419 'use':150 'vaccin':423 've':149 'vine':167,268,369,399 'virus':30,215,395 'voluntari':404 'voluntarili':47 'wash':429 'weaken':75 'wear':48,409 'whether':351 'won':281 'word':152 'work':323 'would':256 'year':52,62,84,111,160 'yet':331 'zarkhin':10 'zarkhinif':440","{""The Oregonian""}"
"Selling psilocybin isn’t legal in Oregon, but a Portland shop is doing it anyway",Savannah Eadens,Portland,"Dec. 01, 2022, 5:00 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 4:05 p.m.",449,"The logo outside Shroom House, a new storefront at 1541 W. Burnside St., is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”NEW!449sharesBy Savannah Eadens | The Oregonian/OregonLiveCautious but eager customers crowded a bright commercial storefront on West Burnside Street on Thursday.On display were typical items. Supplements. Teas. Chocolates. Even jerky.Plus a not-at-all discreet menu of prices for what the store identifies as different strains of dried psilocybin fungus, including 3.5 grams of “Knobby Tops” for $50 and 7 grams of “Albino Penis Envy” for $95.“Are you looking for a functional micro-dose? Or do you want to go on a hike with some color enhancement and sparkles?” an unidentified employee asked a customer.“I just want to have a normal day, but like with a smile,” a man in line replied.Shroom House, at 1541 W. Burnside St., is branding itself as a wellness shop but is very much selling psilocybin in a dispensary-like setting – a retail format that is not legal in Oregon.Oregon’s legal psilocybin program was created under Measure 109 and passed by voters in 2020. That program will allow people 21 and older to take the substance in a controlled, therapeutic environment under the supervision of trained facilitators when psychedelic mushrooms become legal in January 2023, according to the text of the measure. Measure 109 did not allow for the retail sale of psilocybin.Under Measure 110, effective since early 2021, misdemeanor drug possession including psilocybin can result in police issuing tickets with fines up to $100, but not an arrest.The Oregon Health Authority’s site for the program said it will begin accepting applications for manufacturing licenses on January 2, 2023.The state agency confirmed Oregon has no licensed psilocybin facilitators or service centers at this time. But the agency said it’s not responsible for unregulated activity, including unlicensed possession, sale or consumption of psilocybin.That’s local law enforcement’s job, a health authority spokesperson said.Kevin Allen, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau, said via email Thursday that the agency’s Narcotics and Organized Crime unit is aware of the allegations being made online about the location, but referred questions to the Oregon Health Authority.“The nature of the (Narcotics and Organized Crime unit) work requires them to be pretty cautious about what they release publicly, so I can’t say more than the fact that they’re aware of it,” Allen said.The signage outside the store is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”A menu board at Shroom House, 1541 W. Burnside St., features colorful names for strains of dried magic mushrooms.Shroom House, a Canadian company, calls itself an “online dispensary” with “mail-order magic mushrooms.” Representatives did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment Thursday. The website says users must be 19 or older to access.The Portland storefront appears to have popped up in the past few weeks.Inside, it looks like a dispensary or holistic shop: artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space. They even have T-shirts with the logo.Upon entry, customers are required to show two forms of I.D. – a driver’s license and debit or credit card – and fill out a form listing their name and address. They’re asked to become a member of the “Shroom House Society.”Then they can purchase recreational mushrooms with cash. Of course, there’s an ATM in the corner.Inside the new shrooms vending shop at 1541 W. Burnside St. artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space.On the counter, next to a register, a clear glass jar has a written note taped to it: “A tip for your trip.”“This is crazy, everything Oregon is doing with decriminalization, I love it,” one customer who declined to give his name said on his way out. “I can’t see it being shut down,” he said, when asked if he was concerned about the legitimacy.Other customers inside the store Thursday afternoon expressed anxiety at a TV news crew outside. They said they learned about the shop on Reddit, where a user posted a new Portland billboard advertising the shop.The building at 1541 W. Burnside St. is owned by Sunjoy Realty, LLC, according to Secretary of State records. The property’s building manager, Mark Byrum, said the person who owns the new business started the lease within the past two months.There are no listed business in Oregon registered under the name Shroom House, according to the Secretary of State’s website.– Savannah Eadens; seadens@oregonian.com; 503-221-6651; @savannaheadensReporter Lizzy Acker contributed to this story.Our journalism needs your support.

"Gorge commission elects Carina Miller, first Indigenous chair",Gosia Wozniacka,News,"Nov. 28, 2022, 4:15 p.m.","Nov. 28, 2022, 4:02 p.m.",139,"Carina Miller, a member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, was elected as the chair of the Columbia River Gorge Commission – the 35-year-old commission's first indigenous chair.Photo by LaRonn KatchiaNEW!139sharesBy Gosia Wozniacka | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe Columbia River Gorge Commission has elected an Indigenous chair – a first for the 35-year-old commission that has had scant tribal leadership.Carina Miller, a member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, will help the commission balance its sometimes competing missions: to protect the natural beauty of the 292,000-acre Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and to advance the area’s economic development.The scenic area, known for incredible waterfalls, plants and wildlife diversity, and endangered salmon runs, has been home to Indigenous people for millennia. Though tribes ceded lands in the scenic area as part of their treaties with the U.S. government, tribal members retain the rights to fish and gather roots and berries and continue to have a strong link with the river.Miller has served as commissioner since her appointment by Gov. Kate Brown in 2019. She is currently one of three tribal members serving on the 13-member commission. The others are commission vice-chair Pah-tu Pitt, also a Warm Springs member, and commissioner Jerry Meninick, a Yakama Nation elder. Both were appointed by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.That’s a significant rise in tribal representation for a commission that has had just a handful of Indigenous commissioners. Louie Pitt, Pah-tu Pitt’s father, was the first Indigenous person appointed to the commission in 1993. A total of five Indigenous leaders have served on the commission.Miller said her appointment as chair is significant because “the state of Oregon has had a history of not fully supporting tribal sovereignty or always being a good political ally.”The commission, established in 1987 by the states of Oregon and Washington, sets policy for protecting non-federal lands in the gorge. It also serves as an appeals board for land-use decisions in the area. Its forthcoming task: approving the first climate change action plan for the gorge, as mandated by the management plan approved two years ago.Miller, who will take over as chair in January, has a background in economic development. As one of the youngest members of the tribal council at Warm Springs, she worked to bring marijuana cultivation and carbon markets to the reservation. She currently works for nonprofit Vibrant Tribal Economies, studying tribal economic health.Miller remembers visiting the scenic area as a child with her grandmother and great-grandmother, who taught her about the removal of the tribes and instilled the importance of the river to tribal identity. She also learned to be innovative to carry on tribal values, including by working within a system that has long oppressed Native people.“My grandmas really wanted me to be visible, but they also didn’t want us to be tokens,” said Miller. “They (taught me) that even though these systems were built to destroy us, that we had to really go in and understand them, master them, and find different ways forward, better ways.”– Gosia Wozniacka; gwozniacka@oregonian.com; @gosiawozniackaOur journalism needs your support.

Black rodeo gets the spotlight at High Desert Museum in Bend,Jamie Hale,Travel & Outdoors,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:01 a.m.",292,"“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The OregonianNEW!292sharesBy Jamie Hale | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe High Desert Museum has hosted plenty of exhibitions featuring rodeos before, but executive director Dana Whitelaw said one omission has been particularly glaring: people of color.That’s changing with the Bend museum’s latest exhibition, “In the Arena,” she said, which shines a spotlight on the Black rodeo community and aims to help correct a whitewashed stereotype of Western culture.Showcasing photographs from the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, the nation’s only touring Black rodeo, the exhibition deliberately focuses on the people more than the sport. Instead of action shots showing bull riding and barrel racing, there are thoughtful portraits and behind-the-scenes looks at the athletes, families and fans who make up the vibrant community.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok In one image, a woman’s long acrylic nails grace the mane of a horse. In another, a man is seen standing alone with one hand at his belt and the other in the air, visualizing his ride before an event. A series of portraits show off a wide variety of rodeo style, from fans in flashy Western wear to cigarillo-chomping cowboys.“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The Oregonian“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The Oregonian“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The OregonianThe images come courtesy of Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who visited the rodeo in Oakland almost every year from 2008 to 2019. Over the years, she built up a familiarity with the community, she said, making friends and getting to know generations of families. That sense of intimacy is clear in her work, which evokes senses of both playfulness and pride at the rodeo.“I think for me it’s super important to represent a community in a respectful, meaningful, historical way,” Hasbun said. “It’s about uplifting, about lifting up these people and their stories.”For Hasbun, who grew up in a Palestinian family in El Salvador, photographing the rodeo proved to be an educational opportunity. She kept returning with no goal in mind, casually documenting the rodeo as she deepened her connections with the community. It wasn’t until 2019, when the crowds at Bill Pickett really swelled, that Hasbun considered consolidating her material into a book.That book, “The New Black West,” was published this past May. After garnering positive reviews and a passing mention in the New York Times, the book caught the eye of curators at the High Desert Museum, which over the years has featured several rodeo exhibitions – including images from the gay rodeo circuit in 2017.Dana Whitelaw, executive director of the museum, said Hasbun’s images show an “unexpected” side of rodeo culture that hasn’t been given proper attention. Now, several of those photos have been blown up and put on prominent display at the museum, where they’ll remain until next summer.“They push us to think a little bit differently,” Whitelaw said of the photographs. “These are not stereotypical images of the rodeo.”She pointed to one of her favorites in the exhibition, a portrait of two women on horseback dressed in long skirts that flow over the backs of their horses. The black and yellow skirts stand out against the brown, dusty backdrop, their outfits unexpected in the setting.More than just an eye-catching curiosity, Whitelaw said, the Black rodeo exhibition has a real chance to broaden peoples’ understandings of the Western community, and potentially spark more personal connections in the process.“When we think about the types of ways that our audiences connect with museum content, it’s often to see yourself,” Whitelaw said. “That is oftentimes some of the most meaningful emotional connection that we have when we visit a museum. You see something that connects, you see yourself in it.”For Hasbun the project was all about connections. She said she originally focused on the people, the culture and the style because she didn’t really care about the actual sport of the rodeo. What drew her back, year after year, was the warm embrace of the community she found behind the scenes, and the beautiful support they gave one another, she said.“It’s always been embedded in the culture of my work to show a lot of pride and strength and resilience in the people that I photograph,” Hasbun said.At the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, that wasn’t hard to find.If her photographs are any indication, the vibrant community surrounding the Black rodeo seems to be carrying itself just fine. The only difference now is that more people are noticing.“In the Arena” is open now through June 25, 2023. The High Desert Museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, located at 59800 U.S. 97, Bend. Admission is $17 for adults, $15 for seniors and students, and $11 for kids.

Black rodeo gets the spotlight at High Desert Museum in Bend,Jamie Hale,Travel & Outdoors,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:01 a.m.",402,"“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The OregonianNEW!402sharesBy Jamie Hale | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe High Desert Museum has hosted plenty of exhibitions featuring rodeos before, but executive director Dana Whitelaw said one omission has been particularly glaring: people of color.That’s changing with the Bend museum’s latest exhibition, “In the Arena,” she said, which shines a spotlight on the Black rodeo community and aims to help correct a whitewashed stereotype of Western culture.Showcasing photographs from the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, the nation’s only touring Black rodeo, the exhibition deliberately focuses on the people more than the sport. Instead of action shots showing bull riding and barrel racing, there are thoughtful portraits and behind-the-scenes looks at the athletes, families and fans who make up the vibrant community.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok In one image, a woman’s long acrylic nails grace the mane of a horse. In another, a man is seen standing alone with one hand at his belt and the other in the air, visualizing his ride before an event. A series of portraits show off a wide variety of rodeo style, from fans in flashy Western wear to cigarillo-chomping cowboys.“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The Oregonian“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The Oregonian“In the Arena: Photographs from America’s Only Touring Black Rodeo” opens at the High Desert Museum in Bend, featuring photographs from San Francisco Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who documented the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.Jamie Hale/The OregonianThe images come courtesy of Bay Area photographer Gabriela Hasbun, who visited the rodeo in Oakland almost every year from 2008 to 2019. Over the years, she built up a familiarity with the community, she said, making friends and getting to know generations of families. That sense of intimacy is clear in her work, which evokes senses of both playfulness and pride at the rodeo.“I think for me it’s super important to represent a community in a respectful, meaningful, historical way,” Hasbun said. “It’s about uplifting, about lifting up these people and their stories.”For Hasbun, who grew up in a Palestinian family in El Salvador, photographing the rodeo proved to be an educational opportunity. She kept returning with no goal in mind, casually documenting the rodeo as she deepened her connections with the community. It wasn’t until 2019, when the crowds at Bill Pickett really swelled, that Hasbun considered consolidating her material into a book.That book, “The New Black West,” was published this past May. After garnering positive reviews and a passing mention in the New York Times, the book caught the eye of curators at the High Desert Museum, which over the years has featured several rodeo exhibitions – including images from the gay rodeo circuit in 2017.Dana Whitelaw, executive director of the museum, said Hasbun’s images show an “unexpected” side of rodeo culture that hasn’t been given proper attention. Now, several of those photos have been blown up and put on prominent display at the museum, where they’ll remain until next summer.“They push us to think a little bit differently,” Whitelaw said of the photographs. “These are not stereotypical images of the rodeo.”She pointed to one of her favorites in the exhibition, a portrait of two women on horseback dressed in long skirts that flow over the backs of their horses. The black and yellow skirts stand out against the brown, dusty backdrop, their outfits unexpected in the setting.More than just an eye-catching curiosity, Whitelaw said, the Black rodeo exhibition has a real chance to broaden peoples’ understandings of the Western community, and potentially spark more personal connections in the process.“When we think about the types of ways that our audiences connect with museum content, it’s often to see yourself,” Whitelaw said. “That is oftentimes some of the most meaningful emotional connection that we have when we visit a museum. You see something that connects, you see yourself in it.”For Hasbun the project was all about connections. She said she originally focused on the people, the culture and the style because she didn’t really care about the actual sport of the rodeo. What drew her back, year after year, was the warm embrace of the community she found behind the scenes, and the beautiful support they gave one another, she said.“It’s always been embedded in the culture of my work to show a lot of pride and strength and resilience in the people that I photograph,” Hasbun said.At the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, that wasn’t hard to find.If her photographs are any indication, the vibrant community surrounding the Black rodeo seems to be carrying itself just fine. The only difference now is that more people are noticing.“In the Arena” is open now through June 25, 2023. The High Desert Museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, located at 59800 U.S. 97, Bend. Admission is $17 for adults, $15 for seniors and students, and $11 for kids.

Woodburn School District faces $3M suit after football coach convicted of sexually abusing teen,Zane Sparling,Public Safety,,"Nov. 30, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",0,"FILEFile artNEW!By Zane Sparling | The Oregonian/OregonLiveA former student at Woodburn High School sued the district Monday after its former head football coach was convicted of sexually abusing her when she was 17.Nicholas Federico, now 41, was sentenced Nov. 15 to 2½ years in state prison and must register as a sex offender after a jury convicted him of second-degree sexual abuse and luring a minor during the 2017-2018 school year.The suit filed in Marion County Circuit Court seeks $3 million in damages for the student’s pain and suffering, alleging that the district failed to prevent the sexual abuse, some of which occurred in Federico’s office and in his truck while it was parked at a middle school campus.“She’s held Mr. Frederico accountable,” said Barbara Long, the student’s attorney. “And now she wants to hold the school district accountable.”Woodburn School District spokesperson Rachel Danskey declined to comment on the pending litigation.Federico taught the student’s freshman and sophomore weightlifting classes, then posed as a “confidant and teacher she could trust” after the student became pregnant and asked if she could volunteer with the coach to raise her grades before graduation, according to the lawsuit.He provided the student with his personal cell number and began sending explicit messages, according to the lawsuit and records in the criminal case. The sexual abuse began at Federico’s home on prom night when his wife was out of town, the student testified during the jury trial.They continued to meet after the student turned 18, but contact ceased in July 2019, Federico’s defense attorney, Zachary Stern, wrote in court filings in the criminal case.The coach eventually paid the student $20,000, but balked after the victim demanded an additional $10,000, the defense attorney argued. The student then sent intimate images of Federico to his family members, according to Stern, who didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Authorities later recovered “love letters” from other students in Federico’s desk during an investigation, according to court records. Federico’s mother was one of the top administrators at the high school.The criminal case turned political last month after a prosecutor pushed Marion County Circuit Judge Erious Johnson, who was up for election Nov. 8, to determine Federico’s punishment before voters marked their ballots. Johnson ultimately sentenced Federico after losing the election.Court records say Federico had been provisionally licensed as a physical education teacher in Oregon since 2010, though a copy of his certification was not available in a state database.

"The U.S. promised tribes they would always have fish; they do, but the fish pose toxic risks","Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublica",Native American News,,"Nov. 29, 2022, 8:40 a.m.",233,"Lottie Sam, front right, and other women prepare salmon in Toppenish, Wash., before a ceremony held by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Credit:Tony Schick/OPBNEW!233sharesBy Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublicaThis article was originally published by ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Oregon Public Broadcasting.Salmon heads, fins and tails filled baking trays in the kitchen where Lottie Sam prepped for her tribe’s spring feast.The sacred ceremony, held each year on the Yakama reservation in south-central Washington, honors the first returning salmon and the first gathered roots and berries of the new year.“The only thing we don’t eat is the bones and the teeth, but everything else is sucked clean,” Sam said, laughing.Her mother and grandmother taught her that salmon is a gift from the creator, a source of strength and medicine that is first among all foods on the table. They don’t waste it.“The skin, the brain, the head, the jaw, everything of the salmon,” she said. “Everybody’s gonna have the opportunity to consume that, even if it’s the eyeball.”Sam is a member of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. They are among several tribes with a deep connection to salmon in the Columbia River Basin, a region that drains parts of the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, southward through seven U.S. states into the West’s largest river.Sacred Rivers by The Associated PressIt’s also a region contaminated by more than a century of industrial and agricultural pollution, leaving Sam and others to weigh unknown health risks against sacred practices.“We just know that if we overconsume a certain amount of it that it might have possible risks,” Sam said, as she gutted salmon in the bustling kitchen. “It’s our food. We don’t see it any other way.”But while tribes have pushed the government to pay closer attention to contamination, that hasn’t happened. Regulators have done so little testing for toxic chemicals in fish that even public health and environmental agencies admit they don’t have enough information to prioritize cleanup efforts or to fully inform the public about human health risks.So Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica did our own testing, and we found what public health agencies have not: Native tribes in the Columbia River Basin face a disproportionate risk of toxic exposure through their most important food.OPB and ProPublica purchased 50 salmon from Native fishermen along the Columbia River and paid to have them tested at a certified lab for 13 metals and two classes of chemicals known to be present in the Columbia. We then showed the results to two state health departments, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials and tribal fisheries scientists.The testing showed concentrations of two chemicals in the salmon that the EPA and both Oregon and Washington’s health agencies deem unsafe at the levels consumed by many of the 68,000-plus Native people who are members of tribes living in the Columbia River Basin today. Those chemicals are mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which after prolonged exposure can damage the immune and reproductive systems and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.The general population eats so little fish that agencies do not consider it at risk, which means that government protocols are mostly failing to protect tribal health. In fact, the contaminants pose an unacceptable health risk if salmon is consumed even at just over half the rate commonly reported by tribal members today, according to guidelines from the EPA and Washington Department of Health.The potential for exposure extends along the West Coast, where hundreds of thousands of people face increased risks of cancer and other health problems just by adhering to the salmon-rich diet their cultures were built upon.A spring chinook from the Columbia River at the mouth to the Oregon Washington border. Chinook salmon, like the ones OPB and ProPublica sampled, migrate to sea over the course of their lives, where they pick up contaminants that Northwest waters like the Columbia and other rivers deposit in the ocean. EPA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that even with minimal data available, agency staff members have flagged the potential for exposure to chemicals in salmon caught not just in the Columbia but also Washington’s Puget Sound, British Columbia’s Skeena and Fraser rivers, and California’s Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.Tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding millions of acres but preserving their perpetual right to their “usual and accustomed” fishing areas; the Supreme Court later likened this right to being as important to Native people as the air they breathe.The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River.(Mark Graves/Staff)LC-But time and again, the U.S. has not upheld those treaties. Damming the Columbia River destroyed tribal fishing grounds and, along with habitat loss and overfishing, drove many salmon populations to near extinction, wiping some out entirely. Previous reporting has shown how the federal government failed in its promises to compensate tribes for those losses and in some cases worked against tribes’ efforts to restore salmon populations. In addition, the EPA has allowed cleanups to languish, and state regulators have been slow to rein in industrial pollution. That toxic pollution impairs the ability of salmon to swim, feed and reproduce.Continually poor and declining salmon numbers have prompted the White House to acknowledge an environmental justice crisis in the Columbia River Basin.The results of our testing for toxic chemicals point to yet another failure.A Toxic MysteryQuestions over fish safety go back generations in some tribal families, predating government concerns by decades.Karlen Yallup remembers tribal elders telling her the water had been clean enough to drink at Celilo Falls, their primary fishing site on the Columbia River. Yallup’s great-great-grandparents, members of the Warm Springs tribe, lived near the falls and would fish there every day.Voices

On her relationship with salmon: “My grandma’s grandma … fished all day – gave thanks, treated the salmon with respect. … Then, [the area where they fished] was flooded. It was very devastating to the tribes. … Salmon would face some of the hardest times they would ever face. When the salmon is gone, we are gone.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “So you first start by finely mashing the salmon up, and then you add the beaten eggs into the salmon, and then you salt and pepper it through the whole thing, then you shape the patties and put it in flour, make sure it’s fully covered and put it on the pan.”As the industrial revolution boomed, farming, industry and urban sprawl grew throughout the basin. In 1957, the falls were submerged by water that pooled behind The Dalles Dam — one of 18 built on the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake River, to turn the river into a shipping channel, irrigate farmland and generate hydroelectricity. By then, pollution from those new industries had dirtied the water.Tribal elders told Yallup they knew the water was no longer clean enough to drink when they could see changes and hear differences in the way it ran. They also worried about the health impacts of Hanford, a sprawling nuclear weapons production complex dozens of miles upstream. Hanford became one of dozens of heavily polluted sites across the Columbia basin, considered one of the largest and most expensive toxic cleanups in the world.Yallup said her elders began to suspect that whatever was getting into the water was getting into the fish. They became “very worried about the salmon getting the family sick,” she said.It wasn’t until the 1990s, however, that the government and the broader public drew attention to the risk to people eating those fish.In 1992, despite two decades of improving water quality under the Clean Water Act, an EPA study found chemicals embedded in carp from the Columbia River. The results alarmed the region’s tribes, which responded by working with the agency to test more fish and survey members about their fish consumption rates.Those efforts revealed that tribal people, on average, eat six to 11 times more fish than non-tribal members. They also detected more than 92 different contaminants in the fish, some at levels high enough to harm human health.In the years that followed, EPA staff expressed concerns over toxic contamination in report after report, but little happened in response. The issue officially became an agency priority during the administration of President George W. Bush, but the EPA repeatedly fell short of its goals to clean up toxic sites as responsible parties fought over how much it would cost, who would pay and how quickly it needed to be done.Voices

On his relationship with salmon: “My father and mother taught me how to do this. Same with my grandparents. A long time ago, we cooked on alderwood. We get a stick or something and poke through the salmon, and then we’ll cook it on top of, right next to, a fire.”
How he likes to prepare salmon: “Usually I like it when they make dumplings … and then make ‘em kind of like soup. How I make dumplings usually just get a pot, you can put it like halfway or fill it up all the way with water and once that boils, then you can get canned salmon or smoked salmon and break it up in there. Then you can either put a can of corn or dried corn. … Then once that boils down a little bit, then that’s when I would try to be done with the dough, which is just flour and water. Then you break off pieces into the pot.”The agency also never had the money to fulfill its plans for continuous monitoring, said Mary Lou Soscia, the Columbia River coordinator for the EPA, leaving the agency unable to determine whether the river was getting cleaner.“Nobody wanted to pay attention to toxics,” said Soscia, who has been working on river cleanup since the late 1990s. “But there are small amounts of studies that give us like those yellow blinking lights. And when tribal people eat so much fish, it’s something we have to be really, really concerned about.”A member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs prepares wind-dried salmon the traditional way, inside a drying shack, in September 2021.

Credit:Arya Surowidjojo/OPBFinally, Oregon delivered in 2011 what was hailed as a breakthrough moment: It adopted new water-quality standards to protect tribal people’s health. The state vowed to restrict the amount of chemicals released by industrial facilities and wastewater plants so that people could eat over a third of a pound of fish per day without increasing their risk of health problems. That amount of fish was based on a survey of tribal members done in the 1990s.Other states that share the Columbia River or its tributaries were slow to follow suit. Washington waited a decade to adopt equally protective standards; Idaho and Montana still have not.But while Oregon was ahead of its neighbors, state regulators took few steps to ensure polluters actually met the state’s new limits. For as many as half the contaminants at issue, the state said it didn’t have the technology to measure whether polluters met the new stricter criteria.The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality also said it didn’t have the staff to keep pollution permits updated. It let more than 80% of polluters operate with expired permits, meaning they weren’t even being held to new standards.When asked in September for evidence of how the state’s highly touted standard has actually improved water quality, the DEQ said it “does not have significant amounts of data on the concentration of bioaccumulative pollutants in the Columbia River, and therefore does not have any trend information.”Jennifer Wigal, DEQ’s water quality administrator, said the standards were implemented not because of pollution but to ensure that tribal diets were represented.Voices

On her relationship with salmon: “I don’t think we would be here without this food. … Our parents or grandparents just taught us this way, you know, as we were growing up. … So now it’s a habitual thing. … It’s a delicacy, it has nutrients, it has medicine … and so, even today, in 2022, we’re still going to consume it.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “Canning, I’ve been doing it for a long time so it’s simple to me. … Start with fresh salmon, then I add a little bit of salt and pepper. … It’s best to use a pressure canner. … You cut the salmon to fit in the jars, add the salt and pepper, clean the rim of the jar and make sure there are no cracks or anything, and you have to seal the lid.”Wigal also said that when companies release harmful contaminants into the river, most are at such low concentrations that they are below the agency’s ability to detect them. Additionally, most of the contamination affecting fish, the DEQ said, comes not from those polluters but from runoff and erosion from industries like agriculture and logging.But the DEQ also has yet to curtail that source of pollution. Along the Willamette River, which flows through Oregon’s most populated areas and feeds into the Columbia, the EPA determined last year that the state needed to cut mercury pollution from these sources by at least 88% if it was going to meet its standards for protecting human health.Congress tried to take matters into its own hands, but it fell into the same pattern of bold plans and delayed action. In 2016 it amended the Clean Water Act, the seminal law governing water pollution nationwide, to require the EPA to establish a program dedicated to restoring the Columbia. It took four years and a nudge from the Government Accountability Office for the program to actually begin. That same year, in 2020, an EPA regional staffer found that broad swaths of the river were polluted with toxic chemicals and were below the standards of the Clean Water Act.In an emailed response to questions, the EPA repeatedly said Congress gave the agency orders to clean up the Columbia but failed to provide the agency with funding to carry out the work. Even after the agency designated the Columbia an EPA priority, finally elevating the river to the same status as other major ecosystems like the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, it received no additional funding and staff for cleanup or long-term monitoring.“That needs to happen,” Soscia, the agency’s Columbia River coordinator, said. “It hasn’t happened.”A Disproportionate RiskHad the government followed through on its plans for monitoring, it might have found what OPB and ProPublica’s testing revealed: that contamination was high enough that it would warrant at least one of the state health agencies to recommend eating no more than eight 8-ounce servings of salmon in a month.For non-tribal people, who on average eat less than those eight monthly servings, the risk is minute. But surveys show members of some tribes in the Columbia River Basin on average eat twice as much fish as the agency’s recommended eight monthly servings.The testing also revealed the potential for increased cancer risks from PCBs and another class of chemicals known as dioxins. Given an average Columbia River tribal diet, according to recent surveys commissioned by the EPA, the risk is as much as five times higher than what the EPA considers sufficiently protective of public health. This means that, based on the news organizations’ samples, roughly 1 of every 20,000 people would be diagnosed with cancer as a result of eating the average tribal diet — about 16 servings of fish each month — over the course of a lifetime.The harm goes beyond the raw numbers. That’s because the risk is compounded by exposure from other fish and other toxic chemicals, such as pesticides and flame retardants in those same waters, that weren’t included in OPB and ProPublica’s testing because of cost constraints. Those chemicals are known to accumulate in fish. Beyond fish contamination, tribal populations already experience disproportionately high rates of certain cancers.Public health officials caution that any cancer risks must be weighed against the many health benefits of eating fish, including the potential to lower the risk of heart disease. The Oregon and Washington health departments, like those of many states, do not assess cancer risk when setting public health advisories.We showed the result of our testing to public health officials in both Washington and Oregon. Both groups said they would be taking further steps to assess salmon and the exposure risk to tribes.Emerson Christie, a toxicologist with the Washington Department of Health who analyzed the results, said the department will consider whether to issue an official public health advisory based on the news organizations’ findings. “These results do indicate that there’s a potential for a fish advisory,” Christie said.David Farrer, an Oregon Health Authority toxicologist who also reviewed the results, said the agency would coordinate with state environmental regulators and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission about additional testing or potential advisories.Public health advisories and cooking guidance are a last-resort attempt to protect people when larger cleanup efforts fall short or don’t happen at all.These advisories can also be plagued with delays. When tribes collected and tested tissue from the Pacific lamprey back in 2009, they found that the culturally important eel-like fish contained dangerous levels of mercury and PCBs. The Oregon Health Authority responded by issuing a consumption warning in October — but the process took 13 years.And while advisories put constraints on tribes’ traditional diets, they don’t help with the larger issue: that the waters from which they are eating fish are still contaminated — with no plan to clean them up.“The long-term solution to this problem isn’t keeping people from eating contaminated fish — it’s keeping fish from being contaminated in the first place,” Aja DeCoteau, executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, said when the lamprey advisory was issued.Wilbur Slockish Jr. is a longtime fisherman who serves on the inter-tribal fish commission.It is wrong, Slockish said, for the government to allow pollution and then, instead of cleaning it up, decide it can tell people not to eat the fish they always have.“That’s on the back of our people’s health, the health of the land, the health of the water,” he said. “We’re not disposable.”A Fight Too Big to IgnoreSlockish eats a lot of fish.He relies on stockpiles of jarred, dried or smoked salmon to get him through the winter. He said it’s not uncommon for him to eat more than a pound of salmon or lamprey in one sitting, sometimes multiple times per day.He’s a direct descendant of the Klickitat tribe’s Chief Sla-kish, who signed the Yakama Treaty of 1855, guaranteeing his people’s right to the fish. At that time, studies estimate that, on average, Native people in the region ate five to 10 times more fish than they do today. Slockish is not going to stop eating fish because of warnings about chemical contamination.He doesn’t see the alternatives as any better. Many in his family have struggled with heart disease, diabetes and cancer. He connects it to their being forced away from the river and made to eat government-issued commodity foods full of preservatives.“All of our foods were medicine,” he said. “Because there were no chemicals.”Research across the globe has connected the loss of traditional diets with spikes in health problems for Indigenous populations. In one West Coast tribe, the Karuk of Northern California, researchers found a direct link between families’ loss of access to salmon and increased prevalence of diabetes and heart disease.Public health experts agree that wild salmon, wherever it’s caught, remains one of the healthiest sources of protein available, and that chemicals can also contaminate other foods beyond just fish.Tribal leaders also worry more about their members getting too little fish than too much of it. And because salmon are a primary income source for many tribal fishers, they worry that fears over fish safety will drive away customers.But for Columbia River tribes, fish are also a cultural fixture, present at every ceremony. They are shared as customary gifts. Babies teethe on lamprey tails. Salmon heads and backbones are boiled into medicinal broths for the sick and elderly.Tribes up and down the river continue to fight for their right to a traditional diet and to clean fish.Yallup, from the Warm Springs tribe, decided to become an advocate for salmon after hearing from her grandmothers how much more limited their traditions had become.She’s on track to graduate in December from Portland’s Lewis & Clark Law School. Yallup chose the law profession to fight for salmon, she said, and to change laws to protect the river from pollution.“If I had a choice, I would just be a fisherman. I felt the responsibility to have to leave the reservation and have to go to law school,” Yallup said. “It’s such a big fight now. It’s kind of impossible to ignore.”Earlier this year, tribes successfully lobbied for one of their Columbia River fishing sites just east of Portland, known as Bradford Island, to be added to the list of polluted places eligible for cleanup money from the federal Superfund program.In August, the EPA received $79 million to reduce toxic pollution in the Columbia River as part of President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It is the most money ever dedicated to reducing Columbia River contamination. It’s also a fraction of what tribes and advocates say is needed.The Yakama Nation is using some of that EPA money to lead a pilot study into the kind of long-term monitoring that has been a recognized need for decades.Laura Klasner Shira, an environmental engineer for Yakama Nation Fisheries, said the tribe put together four federal grants to pay for its pilot study, which is limited to the area around Bonneville Dam, east of Portland. They hope someday it could grow to span nearly the entire length of the Columbia, up to the Canadian border. But it took 10 years to get as far as they are now.“It’s disappointing that the tribes have to take on this work,” she said, noting that government agencies not only have treaty and legal responsibilities but better funding. “The tribes have been the strongest advocates with the least resources.”They will sample resident fish, young salmon on their way to the ocean, and adult salmon after they’ve returned.They have two years to finish the work. After that, funding for their monitoring becomes a question mark.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive

Since this project is in the early stages, there aren’t answers to some questions.As a longtime member of the Portland community, we’re committed to developing a modern project that’ll create jobs and support the economy. We plan to invest $39 million into the property’s redevelopment. We’re planning to include a bike lane, sidewalk and other amenities to the site to improve pedestrian safety.The facility will have LEED silver certification and operate in a sustainable way. We have a strong record in sustainable development, including future-looking elements like EV truck charging. We just announced two significant EV projects on the West Coast.My team has met and presented the redevelopment plan to the Argay Terrace and Parkrose neighborhood associations and invited and received feedback. We’ll continue to share updates with the community.Our team lives and works here – including me. We support local organizations, including the Portland chapters of The Boys & Girls Club and Habitat for Humanity. Prologis is a proud member and partner of Portland.

Portland’s Cully neighborhood among areas to see increased air quality monitoring,The Associated Press,Environment,"Nov. 26, 2022, 3:30 p.m.","Nov. 26, 2022, 1:36 p.m.",0,"“Having actual hard data is sometimes the only way that state or federal agencies will listen and actually value community feedback,” says Verde’s Oriana Magnera. Verde, a community-based environmental advocacy group, will receive nearly $120,000 to install air quality monitors in the Cully neighborhood. File photoMark Graves/The OregonianNEW!By The Associated PressTwo of Oregon’s most economically disadvantaged and racially diverse communities — one in Portland and the other on the south coast — are getting a boost in their fight against air pollution.The air-quality challenges facing “environmental justice communities” are being highlighted by the Environmental Protection Agency’s grants to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, environmental nonprofit Verde and the Confederated Tribes of Coos Lower Umpqua & Siuslaw Indians. The grants are aimed at increasing air quality monitoring and awareness in communities where many residents are poor, people of color, and disproportionately burdened by pollution — like those living near industrial facilities or highways.DEQ spokesperson Lauren Wirtis said the agency is set to receive nearly $500,000 that will be used to work with local communities, universities, and local agencies that will co-design a monitoring framework to collect better data that could lead to more action from the state.“Part of what that looks like is allowing communities to leverage a library of instruments that DEQ maintains that would monitor (particulate matter) and diesel in their local area,” she told Oregon Public Broadcasting.The agency will also be working with Neighbors for Clean Air, an environmental air quality advocacy group. Executive Director Mary Peveto said she’s thrilled more air quality monitoring units will be installed that will collect data to be collected in real-time. She said it will allow members of the community to ask questions about how the data is collected, what areas are most impacted and what can be done to reduce pollution.Peveto said the grant money “first and foremost, I think, helps to immediately recenter this in community empowerment when the data is created or collected.”The community-based environmental advocacy group Verde will receive nearly $120,000 to install air quality monitors in the Cully neighborhood. The monitoring will focus on airborne black carbon, or soot.Cully is one of Portland’s most racially diverse neighborhoods, where more than half of the residents are people of color. According to DEQ data, the Cully neighborhood experienced the second-highest levels of arsenic compared to other sites in 2018.Verde’s Oriana Magnera said more needs to be done to reduce air pollution in the neighborhood.Cully is exposed to aviation pollution from nearby Portland International Airport, Magnera said. It’s also polluted by diesel trucks and trains that pass through the area. And glass-recycling and asphalt-grinding plants add to the neighborhood’s pollution.Magnera said she hopes the air quality monitors will give community members the opportunity to collect their own data and weave it with their lived experience. She said she’s also hopeful the data is another way to identify other polluters in the area and ensure there is an opportunity to hold them accountable.“Having actual hard data is sometimes the only way that state or federal agencies will listen and actually value community feedback,” she said.The Coos tribes’ $500,000 share of the grant will increase community engagement and education on outdoor and indoor quality and develop a network of air quality monitors, said Chief Executive Officer Lee Ann Wander.Without adequate air-quality monitoring around the tribes’ reservation and trust lands, “there is a presumption that coastal air is always clean,” she said.“Because of this misconceived notion, many of our at-risk community members spend more time outdoors and suffer from health issues directly relating to poor air quality,” Wander said.-- By MONICA SAMAYOA, Oregon Public BroadcastingIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",215,"'000':39,171,350,547 '120':38,349 '2018.verde':410 '500':170,546 'accord':390 'account':520,646 'action':202 'actual':2,18,522,538 'add':462 'adequ':578 'advocaci':33,254,343 'agenc':14,102,164,184,240,534 'aim':128 'air':42,85,88,131,249,252,265,353,422,472,568,580,596,628 'air-qual':87,579 'airborn':365 'airport':436 'allow':213,287 'also':242,441,497 'alway':598 'ann':576 'anoth':502 'area':234,302,452,510 'around':583 'arsenic':404 'ask':293 'asphalt':459 'asphalt-grind':458 'associ':55 'at-risk':610 'aviat':430 'awar':135 'base':31,341 'better':195 'black':366 'boost':80 'broadcasting.the':239 'broadcastingif':637 'burden':148 'carbon':367 'challeng':90 'chief':572 'clean':248,599 'co':188 'co-design':187 'coast':76 'coastal':595 'collect':194,274,278,300,337,482 'color':145,389 'communiti':20,30,66,94,137,180,214,291,329,340,477,540,554,613 'community-bas':29,339 'compar':405 'compens':658 'confeder':117 'coo':120,544 'could':198 'creat':335 'culli':47,358,395 'data':4,196,275,298,333,393,485,500,524 'depart':108 'deq':222,392 'design':189 'develop':564 'diesel':230,444 'direct':624 'director':257 'disadvantag':62 'disproportion':147 'divers':65,377 'done':310,419 'econom':61 'educ':557 'empower':330 'engag':555 'ensur':512 'environment':32,92,100,110,112,251,342 'execut':256,573 'experi':492 'experienc':397 'expos':428 'face':91 'facil':156 'feder':13,533 'feedback':21,541 'fight':83 'file':49 'first':318 'focus':363 'foremost':320 'framework':192 'get':78 'give':476 'glass':455 'glass-recycl':454 'grant':104,126,316,551 'graves/the':51 'grind':460 'group':34,255,344 'half':382 'hard':3,523 'health':622 'help':323 'highest':401 'highlight':97 'highways.deq':158 'hold':518 'hope':470,498 'identifi':505 'immedi':325 'impact':305 'increas':130,553 'indian':124 'indoor':561 'industri':155 'instal':41,271,352 'instrument':220 'intern':435 'issu':623 'justic':93 'land':589 'lauren':160 'lead':199 'lee':575 'level':402 'leverag':216 'librari':218 'like':151,211 'link':651 'listen':16,536 'live':153,491 'local':179,183,233 'look':210 'lower':121 'magnera':26,413,437 'maintain':223 'mani':139,607 'mari':258 'matter':228 'may':656 'member':288,478,614 'misconceiv':605 'money':317 'monica':633 'monitor':44,133,191,226,267,355,361,474,570,582 'near':37,154,169,348 'nearbi':433 'need':416 'neighbor':246 'neighborhood':48,359,378,396,465 'neighborhood.cully':426 'network':566 'nonprofit':113 'notion':606 'offic':574 'one':67,371,648 'opportun':480,516 'oregon':58,107,237,635 'oregoniannew':52 'oriana':25,412 'outdoor':559,618 'part':206 'particul':227 'pass':449 'peopl':143,387 'peveto':259 'photomark':50 'plant':461 'pollut':150,423,431,442,507 'pollution.magnera':467 'pollution.peveto':313 'pollution.the':86 'poor':142,627 'portland':69,373,434 'presstwo':56 'presumpt':593 'product':641 'protect':101 'public':238,636 'purchas':639 'qualiti':43,89,111,132,253,266,354,473,562,569,581,629 'question':294 'racial':64,376 'real':281 'real-tim':280 'receiv':36,168,347,657 'recent':326 'recycl':456 'reduc':312,421 'regist':643 'relat':625 'reserv':586 'resid':140,385 'risk':612 'said':162,260,284,314,414,438,468,494,571,601,631 'said.the':543 'samayoa':634 'say':22 'second':400 'second-highest':399 'set':166 'share':548 'site':408,654 'siuslaw':123 'sometim':6,526 'soot.cully':369 'south':75 'spend':615 'spokesperson':159 'state':11,205,531 'suffer':620 'think':322 'thrill':263 'time':282,617 'told':236 'train':447 'tribe':118,545,585 'truck':445 'trust':588 'umpqua':122 'unit':268 'univers':181 'use':175 'valu':19,539 'verd':23,27,114,345 'wander':630 'wander.without':577 'way':9,503,529 'weav':487 'wirti':161 'work':177,244 'would':225",
Ask Amy: Abuse survivor’s questions linger even as an adult,Amy Dickinson,Advice,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 12:02 a.m.",0,"Amy Dickinson writes the syndicated Ask Amy column.Tribune Content AgencyNEW!By Amy DickinsonDear Amy: My parents divorced when I was seven, after my mother had an affair with one of my father’s employees.He was much younger and a registered sex offender, but my mother moved him into our house immediately.He started commenting on my breasts at a very early age.When I was 14 he offered to give me lessons on sex. At age 16 he was relentlessly commenting on my body, and when I finally had enough and yelled at him to stop, my mother grounded me for being disrespectful.At age 17 he exposed himself and performed a sex act in front of me.I left home at age 17. I told my mother that I was very hurt that she never told him to stop the sexual abuse.She screamed at me and said that I am “too sensitive,” and that I was never sexually abused because her boyfriend (now husband) never actually touched me.I’m 50 years old now, and I have had difficulty with intimacy my whole adult life.My mother blames me for turning her life upside down because I tried to hurt myself when I was 10 because I felt so terrible and dirty.I attempted suicide at age 16 because I felt like I was destined to be her husband’s toy.My family claims that this was not abuse because he didn’t rape me.I have been to therapy and I have done a lot of work on myself. Amy, I have felt useless and dirty since I was 10 years old. Was I abused, or am I just not able to have an intimate relationship because of my own bad behavior?– Still WonderingDear Wondering: You have a lingering and necessary desire for validation; this is a direct result of your family’s choice to continuously deny the traumatic experiences you were subjected to throughout your childhood.Yes, you were abused. Your mother’s husband attempted to groom you throughout your childhood. Exposing himself and performing a sex act in front of you is a crime.Read some of the harrowing accounts of (adult) women traumatized by Harvey Weinstein doing what this man did to you, and you will see the long-term and devastating impact of this kind of sexual misconduct and abuse. (Weinstein is currently on trial for rape; his criminal behavior also included exposing himself and performing a sex act in front of women).You were a child. No one protected you at the time, and they are not protecting you now.Your abuser robbed you of your self-esteem. Survivors of sexual abuse often struggle with trust and intimacy. This response is a natural reaction of you continuing to protect yourself, the way you had to do all during childhood.I hope you will continue with therapy.RAINN.org offers many valuable services to abuse survivors, including a 24/7 online “chat” line where you can contact a counselor. The “Survivor Stories” featured on their site include stories much like yours, told by stalwart survivors who report many of the feelings and reactions you are also experiencing.It is important that you understand that you are NOT alone.Dear Amy: I am a 62-year-old man. I am seeking a new relationship with a woman. What is age-appropriate for me when I’m looking for a new partner?– Aged OutDear Aged Out: You and I are the same age, roughly described as: “I’m anyone-who-will-have-me-years-old.”Age is less important than maturity, and in that regard, life experience, work ethic, responsibility and reliability are all core values to consider, regardless of the other person’s age.Dear Amy: My husband and I just about rolled off our seats laughing at the letter from “Wondering,” the wife/mom who felt their daughters should know about the dad’s previous long-ago, short-lived first marriage.This was exactly the same situation that we faced!We weren’t sure when to let our teenage daughters in on “the family secret,” but the perfect circumstance revealed itself.One day while out for breakfast, we overheard a woman talking about her daughter in college getting married.Our older daughter asked what we would say if she decided to get married so young. We looked at each other and smiled, knowing this was the right time. After we finished describing my husband’s youthful marriage, we continued to eat.Our daughters sat there with their forks frozen halfway to their mouths!It has become a funny family story.– Second WifeDear Wife: It always comes as a shock to learn that your parents have a past.You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

New research pinpoints major factors in NW’s deadly 2021 heatwave,Tribune News Service,Environment,,"Nov. 25, 2022, 10:01 a.m.",0,"Among other conclusions, one new research paper found that the heat wave was so unprecedented it essentially broke most of the standard tools used to measure the human influence on heat waves. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times/TNS)TNSNEW!By Tribune News ServiceResearchers are shedding new light on last year’s anomalous and extreme Pacific Northwest heat wave, in which more than 100 Oregonians died. One study published this week said such heat waves could become 20 times more likely to occur if current carbon emissions continue unabated. Another said they may also be nearly 10 degrees hotter.The nine-day event in late June and early July 2021 seared parts of Northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, where Canada saw its highest temperature on record, 121.3 degrees. The heat wave claimed hundreds of lives, sparked several devastating wildfires and killed an estimated 1 billion sea creatures.Such an event would have been “virtually impossible” in the 1950s, but atmospheric warming has already increased its probability to about a 0.5% chance per year, according to one study out of Columbia University, published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Should warming surpass 2 degrees Celsius — the upper limit set by the International Panel on Climate Change — that probability could soar to a 10% chance per year as soon as 2050.“The single biggest control on how bad heat waves will get — in excess of how bad they already currently are — is the amount of CO2 that we put into the atmosphere,” said Samuel Bartusek, a Ph.D. student at Columbia’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the lead author of the study. “There’s really only one solution to the problem of putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is to stop doing it.”Bartusek said the extraordinary heat wave was “shocking” both for the people who experienced it and for the scientific community, which is why researchers hope to gain a better understanding of its physical mechanisms and its relationship to climate change.“This was an extremely weird event,” said Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who co-authored another paper on the heat wave published last week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. “It was also tragic, of course, because of the mortality that resulted from it.”Among other conclusions, that paper found that the heat wave was so unprecedented it essentially broke most of the standard tools used to measure the human influence on heat waves.“At the end of the day, we calculated not only was the event impossible without climate change — it was impossible with climate change. And of course, it happened, so that means that the model is wrong,” Wehner said.Wehner said such statistical outliers make it difficult to forecast the future frequency of such events with certainty. However, his paper does include findings about temperature, noting that global warming caused as much as a 1.8 degree increase in maximum temperatures during the heat wave.Future warming could lead to a roughly 9 degree increase in heatwave temperatures by the end of the 21st century, the paper says.“The bottom line is that the amount of climate change we get is really determined by us, and by the people we elect to either mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases or not,” he said. “And the less we do, the worse things get.”The Columbia researchers also found that several factors converged to help create the blistering heat dome, including anomalously dry soils and disruptions to the jet stream.In California and other parts of the Western United States, increasing heat, drought and aridification are contributing to long-term drying of soils, which means there’s less water to be evaporated into the air, Bartusek explained.“And if there is less ability for evaporation to come out of the ground, there is a greater heating effect — where the air that’s just above the surface will be heated more effectively,” he said. He added that in some areas it’s likely there was “this feedback process going on where the land surface helped amplify some of the highest temperatures.”The jet stream — the fast-flowing air currents in the upper level of the atmosphere that guide weather systems from west to east — also played a role in the heat wave, according to the study. Before and during the event, the jet stream “buckled” into a wave pattern and slowed down, essentially locking the weather system in place and allowing the dome of heat to build up over the region.The researchers noted that the effect of climate change on the jet stream is still being debated, although some scientists believe such wave patterns are becoming more frequent and extreme due to human activity. Wehner said the question is “one of the most interesting problems in climate science right now.”“It definitely remains a possibility that we would see more of these kinds of unusual flows with global warming,” he said.Kai Kornhuber, an adjunct associate research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and another of the Columbia study’s authors, said the findings highlight how deviations among soil moisture levels, the jet stream and other factors can drive temperatures even beyond their usual magnitudes.“Sometimes these factors just align and you get those conditions that cause a perfect storm,” he said. “What is important to mention here, though, is that each of those drivers do exhibit increasing trends that are associated with climate change ... These types of coincidences might just occur with a higher likelihood in the future, just because these common drivers are all linked to climate trends.”As for how likely it is that such heat waves will reach that yearly 10% probability by 2050, much depends on which emissions pathway society ends up taking. But “given the accelerated trends in extreme weather events globally, there are reasons to believe that these estimates might even be a bit conservative,” Kornhuber said.He and the other researchers noted that while some of the studies’ numbers and predictions may differ, their key messages are very similar — that the extreme heat wave was essentially impossible at pre-industrial emission levels.“What is important in this aspect is these methods all agree that climate change plays a major role in every heat wave that we observe nowadays,” Kornhuber said.Though the findings are dire, the researchers said they could help inform future modeling of such events and help people to better prepare. Many parts of the Pacific Northwest were unequipped for such extreme heat, including homes without air conditioning and infrastructure systems unable to handle such strain. Wehner said improved adaptation efforts and contingency plans will help, but that ultimately, such events “are going to get worse because there’s a lot of climate change that’s baked into the system.”“The more we can reduce our emissions — eventually getting down to none, to zero — and the sooner we can do that, the better in terms of avoiding even worse tragedies,” he said.-- Hayley Smith, Los Angeles Times©2022 Los Angeles Times.

Thinking of pruning that Japanese maple now? Here’s why you should wait: Ask an expert,Kym Pokorny,Homes & Gardens,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 9:22 a.m.",0,"The best time to prune deciduous plants is in the late winter or early spring. Here's why. Oregonian file photo. LC- THE OREGONIANNEW!By Kym Pokorny | For The Oregonian/OregonLiveIt’s cold and rainy but there’s still things to do in the garden if you have the inclination. For answers to your questions, turn to Ask an Expert, an online question-and-answer tool from Oregon State University’s Extension Service. OSU Extension faculty and Master Gardeners reply to queries within two business days, usually less. To ask a question, simply go to the OSU Extension website, type it in and include the county where you live. Here are some questions asked by other gardeners. What’s yours?Q: We are brand new owners of a Japanese maple in the backyard of a house we recently purchased. We’ve heard the best time to trim our tree is in the fall after the leaves have fallen off. But here we are, almost in December, and our leaves haven’t fallen off. It occurs to us that trimming now when the leaves are still on could be advantageous. We could see much better what we need to do. We want to change its shape a little. Is this acceptable? – Clackamas CountyA: Although it may seem counterintuitive, the best time to prune deciduous plants is in late winter/early spring. When you are pruning live tissue, you are “wounding” it, which makes it more vulnerable to insects, disease and, in colder weather, freezing of the unprotected cells. In early spring, you should be able to see the shape of the tree better, and you’ll get to know which are dead branches and twigs, and which are still viable enough to grow leaves. – Kris LaMar, OSU Extension Master GardenerMealybugsOSU Extension ServiceWhat’s a mealybug?Q: Plants in our landscape, including peony stems that have been cut back, have little white blobs. They kind of look like marshmallows. They turn orange when squished. It’s spreading in my landscape. – Jackson CountyA: These insects are known as mealybugs. Mealybugs are grayish white, soft-bodied insects that are usually segmented and feature indicative wax filaments radiating out from their bodies.These slow-moving pests are covered with a mealy wax and tend to cluster in large numbers to feed, appearing as cottony masses in leaf axils and other protected areas. Heavy feeding can slow peony growth and cause dieback.Mealybugs also produce a sticky, sweet substance known as honeydew as a byproduct of feeding. Honeydew attracts ants that protect mealybugs from natural predators and hosts sooty mold fungus growth. Healthy peonies can handle light mealybug activity, but if feeding is heavy, a forceful stream of water or application of an insecticidal soap or narrow-range oil may be warranted. Here is a helpful publication. – Chris Rusch, OSU Extension Master GardenerWhy are my arborvitae dying?Q: I have four arborvitae that have died or are in the dying phase. These beauties were planted to provide a boundary surrounding two sides of our home. Can I keep it from affecting the others in the row? – Washington CountyA: There could be several reasons. I’ll attach an article explaining the problems, but the reasons are usually too much water, crowding or heat and drought.Yours are old and have withstood many wet springs, so I doubt it is the first reason, although if some of your irrigation techniques have changed, you will at least want to know that they don’t like standing water. Did the ones that died have more water than the others for some reason? In that case, there might be a root rot problem.The drought and heat we have been having is a more likely cause, and you will see other arborvitae hedges around the area with dead specimens in the center or ends of the row. Even though these plants have survived 25 years, they need some water through our increasingly hot summers.As to the issue of crowding, I can’t really tell from your pictures if this could be the case, but since you will take out the dead trees and the others in the picture look healthy, it probably won’t be an issue. Here’s some more information. Notice the information about pruning halfway down the above article.Also, I’ll attach this information from the University of Massachusetts about pruning arborvitae:“Arborvitae will produce growth from dormant buds on old wood. The lower branches need sunlight and air flow to grow so you will need to continue to trim these trees. Both the vertical shoots at the top and throughout the tree should be trimmed so that they don’t shade and prevent air flow for the bottom branches. The trimming stimulates further growth. The base of the shrub should be wider than the top. This will also help prevent tree damage from ice and snow buildup in the winter.”– Rhonda Frick-Wright, OSU Extension Master GardenerCascaraOSU Extension ServiceThis cascara tree may need to be replacedQ: We planted this cascara tree in early April, and this is its current state. Many of the branches are dead or appear dead with just a few leafy branches. There are a couple of live leaves growing directly off of the trunk at about the middle of the tree, as well as something shaggy that I assume is lichen. The tree is about 18 feet tall and 1.75-inch caliper.It is in a full sun area on the south side of the house near the street in the spot where Urban Forestry instructed it to be planted. It is well mulched and was watered pretty well throughout the summer. (The mulch was from a free chip drop and has mushrooms growing in it. I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.)We also have two other smaller cascaras (0.75-inch caliper) in the yard that look much better with leaves on all of the branches. Those two were bought at a different nursery. The tree in the picture was one of only a few we could find that fit the size requirement for Portland street trees. It was burlapped at purchase, which of course we removed before planting.My main question is, is this tree OK for the long haul? How should we proceed? Should we prune the dead wood? Did we just buy a bad tree? What should we look for next time? – Multnomah CountyA: You can always get a second opinion from an arborist, but the holes at the base of the tree and the bark disintegration are pretty serious. The root flare looks OK, although the tree may have been planted a little shallow since so many roots are visible.I think, if it were my tree, I would take that picture to the nursery where you bought it, since it hasn’t even been a year, and get your money back or a new tree. A reputable nursery should do that if you tell them the whole story and show them the pictures.The only issue you might have is that the wood chips you used for mulch are touching the tree roots. It would be hard to believe that a pathogen could travel that fast and do that much damage to a healthy tree, but there is some research that indicates you should not have wood chips touching the tree trunk or roots above ground. I’ll attach the article. This tree has been severely stressed, and even if it manages to limp along for a year or two, it will never be the healthy, beautiful, strong tree you want for a street tree. So sorry, but it is time to replace it. – Rhonda Frick-WrightPersimmon treeOSU Extension ServicePersimmon’s fall color display is a bustQ: I have two ‘Fuyu’ persimmons and neither one had the fall color I was hoping for. The leaves stay green, curl up and fall off. Everything I read about persimmons highlights the amazing fall color. Any idea why I don’t have the leaf colors? – Multnomah CountyA: Like most unusual factors these days, you can probably blame it on the weather:“Several environmental factors can diminish the fall foliage colors. Very warm weather conditions encourage late season chlorophyll production and vegetative growth, which discourages initiation of autumn colors. An early frost before abscission kills the leaf before the pigments reach their maximum development, causing it to simply shrivel and fall to the ground. Long periods of wet, cloudy weather in fall produce a drab coloration because of low light intensity.”You can read about the science behind color changes in the rest of this article.

Dear Abby: Assisted living resident’s romance upsets some family members,Abigail Van Buren,Advice,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 12:04 a.m.",0,"Dear AbbyNEW!By Abigail Van BurenDEAR ABBY: Two and a half years ago we lost my dad, who was 94. He and Mom had been married 72 years. She entered assisted living right before COVID -- with all its difficulties -- set in. We made it through that, we’re all vaccinated now and her facility has opened back up.Mom has met and befriended a similarly aged widower. They eat together, walk, attend activities and enjoy sitting and talking together every day. He always walks her back to her room and nicely bids her a good night. They reach for one another’s hands to hold while talking about their departed spouses and are a source of great comfort for each other. I learned about this friendship from facility staff, so I had time to digest it alone before talking with my mother about it.At first, I was nervous because I did not want her to be hurt. But I quickly realized that this relationship is very good for both of them, as they share similar histories and circumstances.Mom has recently found out that this man’s daughters are upset about their friendship, and she feels badly about it. She says she would never do anything to hurt him. I’ve told her she needs to give his daughters time to wrap their minds around their friendship. Abby, what can I do to help the daughters build trust in this situation? -- DELICATE SITUATION IN ARKANSASDEAR DELICATE SITUATION: Your mother’s is not the first romance to blossom in a situation like this, and it won’t be the last.What has happened is a blessing, and I hope the man’s daughters will come to regard it as one. Reaching out to them isn’t a bad idea, if you think it may calm the situation and you can do it without making them more defensive than they already appear to be. The older folks are doing nothing wrong. They have a right to be happy in their remaining years. If there is a religious adviser connected to the assisted living facility, he or she might be able to help you.DEAR ABBY: I come from a very small town which has only one school. My sister recently returned to attend her 50th class reunion. It was very informal and held in a local tavern. The event was announced on social media, but no formal invitations were sent out.When my sister spotted a man who had graduated the following year, she approached him and asked, “What are you doing here? You didn’t graduate with our class!” He answered that he had participated in sports with a number of the graduates and wanted to see them again.Considering that the event was casual, held in a public place and that my sister didn’t organize the event, send out invitations or act as a hostess, I thought her remark was out of line and mean. She strongly disagrees. What do you think? -- SMALL-TOWN SIS IN ILLINOISDEAR SIS: Depending upon your sister’s tone of voice (and degree of sobriety) when she asked that question, it may have come across as an expression of surprise or curiosity. However, if it was asked in a hostile or accusatory manner, I agree with you that it was out of line and mean.Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Idaho students largely abandon campus after 4 slain; security drives some to class,The Associated Press,Public Safety,,"Nov. 30, 2022, 4:51 p.m.",0,"Flowers, a stuffed animal, and a framed image featuring the photos of the four people found dead at a house on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho, rest in the snow in front of the house on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022. The university will be holding a system-wide vigil, Wednesday evening, Nov. 30, 2022 in memory of the students, as investigators continue to look for a suspect and motive in the killings. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)APNEW!By The Associated PressIn a normal year, University of Idaho students would be bustling between classes and the library, readying for the pre-finals cramming period known as “dead week.”On Wednesday, however, a little under half the students appeared to be gone, choosing to stay home and take classes online rather than return to the town where the killings of four classmates remain unsolved, said Blaine Eckles, the university’s dean of students. Some students who were in attendance were relying on university-hired security staffers to drive them to class because they didn’t want to walk across campus alone.The Moscow Police Department has yet to name a person of interest in the stabbing deaths of Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls, Idaho; Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington. The three women lived together in a rental home across the street from campus, and Chapin was there staying that night.A county coroner said they were likely asleep when they were attacked. Two weeks later investigators have yet to find a weapon used in the killings — believed to be a military-style knife — or elaborate on why they think the killings were “targeted.”The killings have left the university and the small farming community that contains it shell-shocked.“When we lose any students, especially under these circumstances, my heart is absolutely broken,” Eckles said. “It shakes you to your core a little bit, knowing that in this community, which is incredibly safe in general, can have something this horrific happen.”Now, as students and faculty members try to navigate a quagmire of grief and fear, government agencies and community members are searching for answers and trying to help lessen the damage.Gov. Brad Little announced last week that he was directing up to $1 million in state emergency funds for the investigation. The FBI has assigned 44 people to the case — half of them stationed in Moscow — and the Idaho State Police has 15 troopers helping with community patrols and another 20 investigators working the case.Some community members started online fundraising campaigns to support family members and friends of the slain students. A university alum began raising money to equip women on campus with handheld personal safety alarms. By last week, Kerry Uhlorn had brought in more than $18,000, ordered more than 700 of the alarms and had plans to buy 900 more, Boise television station KTVB reported.Thousands of people were expected to join the university community in mourning Wednesday evening, with several simultaneous candlelight vigils scheduled across the state. The school districts in Boise and Meridian announced plans to light up their athletic fields at the same time in solidarity.Still, the question for faculty members and students remains: How do they focus on learning with four friends gone and a killer on the loose? Staffers are talking directly to students about how to handle the challenge, Eckles said.“It’s the elephant in the room, right? It’s hard to do that,” Eckles said. “Our faculty are also really understanding that it’s going to be a hard time for students to kind of focus and concentrate at this time. So they’re being very patient and leading with a lot of grace. And quite frankly, I think our students are doing that with our employees as well.”Local law enforcement agencies have seen an uptick in calls reporting suspicious behavior.“We understand there is a sense of fear in our community,” the Moscow Police Department wrote on Nov. 27. Since the killings, the number of people requesting welfare checks, in which an officer is sent to check on a person’s wellbeing, has doubled.The university has also seen an increase in people calling its “Vandal Care” phone line to report that they were struggling or worried someone else was struggling with an issue, Eckles said.“While I personally am very confident that the police will resolve (the deaths), until that happens, no one is resting easy,” he said. “There’s someone out there that took the lives of four of our Vandals, and we don’t know who they are. We don’t know where they are.”Eckes added he hopes the vigils will offer some temporary comfort, but the community will not “ultimately be able to heal until someone is brought to justice for this crime.”Some of the victims’ family members were expected to attend the vigils.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive

"Winterhawks hang on to beat Royals, end losing streak","Dylan Bumbarger, community blogger",Winterhawks,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 5:56 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Dylan Bumbarger, community bloggerAn unconvincing win over the conference’s lowest-ranked team, but good enough to stop a 3-game losing streak for the Portland Winterhawks. They beat the Victoria Royals 3-1 Friday night at the Coliseum. Power play goals by Gabe Klassen and Ryder Thompson early in the 3rd made the difference.They won despite being outshot by Victoria, who had outshot opponents in only 4 of 24 games all season, and despite trailing after the 1st period, the first time all season Victoria lead a game after the first 20 minutes.Game previewGame thread with game updates and postgame reaction.The off day forumScoring summary2:52 VIC Carter Dereniwsky (Teydon Trembecky, Justin Kipkie) 0-1The decisive goal for Victoria’s season-first lead after 20. Kipkie from the right point wraps a pass around the boards behind the net, it gets to Dereniwsky behind the net via a touch from Trembecky. Jan Špunar is terribly slow to react to the pass and Dereniwsky beats him to the post with a wraparound with Špunar basically looking in the other direction. A goal no WHL goalie should give up.20:27 POR Jack O’Brien (Aidan Litke, Ryan McCleary) 1-1Winterhawks start the 2nd well. McCleary from the left boards puts it toward the net, Litke helps it on its way to the front, and O’Brien at the top of the crease gets a little touch on it to put it off the post and in.43:28 POR (pp) Gabe Klassen (Jack O’Brien, Luca Cagnoni) 2-1With Portland on a 5 on 3, quick passes from Cagnoni and O’Brien get Klassen an opportunity in the slot, and he finishes nicely.44:49 POR (pp) Ryder Thompson (Robbie Fromm-Delorme, Dawson Pasternak) 3-1The power play becomes a 5 on 4 and Portland scores again. Thompson one-times a shot from the blue line, not particularly powerful but Nicholas Cristiano only gets 75% of it and it trickles behind him and in.NarrativesPregame: Victoria is bad and Portland is playing badly; the Winterhawks were hoping for a decisive win to show they were no longer playing badly.1st period: The first lead of the season for the Royals after the 1st period, but it was kind of a fluke. A bad goal allowed by Špunar, two big saves by Cristiano along with quite a few lucky saves, and Portland trailed despite being the better team. 2nd period: The Winterhawks got the tie in the first 30 seconds, and then were outplayed by the Royals the rest of the period. Victoria still hasn’t led after 2 periods all season.3rd period: Portland capitalized twice on the early 5 on 3, and then the game became a slog, with both teams playing like it was their third game in three nights. Just good enough for Portland to win.Won on offense, defense, or special teams: Special teams, with Portland getting the 2 power play goals and going 5 for 5 on the penalty kill. Best team won?: Yes.Injuries/suspensions: Dawson Pasternak returned after missing two games. Portland was still missing a lot of depth and 15-year-old Ryan Miller made his WHL debut and played a few minutes. Victoria was missing their top goalie, Tyson Palmer, who might be wanting a trade, and 5-5 Dane Marcus Almquist, who’s getting ready for World Juniors.The playersTop 10Stat lineJack O’BrienPOR1 goal, 1 assistOnly credited with the goal at the moment, but the assist will come.

They’ve been outshot in 3 out of 4 after starting the season 20-0. They go back up I-5 for the third time in ten days to face a rested Everett, and that game is a pick ‘em. On the bright side they increased their lead over Seattle at the top of the Western Conference to 5 points, although they gave Seattle another game in hand.Victoria RoyalsPut together a good effort, but they’ve now lost 10 in a row and it’s a hopeless season. Spokane’s and Edmonton’s records are just as bad, but Edmonton just won a league championship and Spokane has some top-end young players.

Dear Doctor: Do AREDS 2 vitamins help moderate the effects of glaucoma?,Dr. Keith Roach,Health,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 72-year-old male in good health who was told this week that my eyes have shown the beginning of glaucoma. There is no change in my 20/20 vision yet. In 2014, I had cataract surgery in both eyes. Is there any evidence that AREDS 2 vitamins (special eye vitamins) will do anything to moderate the effects of glaucoma? -- R.C.ANSWER: Although there are many eye diseases, three of the most important ones in older adults are glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. There can be some confusion over what these are.Glaucoma is a disease of the retina that is usually (but not always) associated with high pressure in the eye. A person can get glaucoma with normal eye pressures, and some people with high eye pressures never get glaucoma. But, we often treat people with high pressures to prevent glaucoma from developing, and will certainly treat people with glaucoma and normal eye pressures with medication -- almost always eye drops to reduce eye pressure. Some people with glaucoma, or those who are at risk due to eye pressure or anatomy, benefit from laser surgery rather than medication. Eye doctors screen for glaucoma with a comprehensive eye exam, including a careful look at the retina, and by measuring eye pressures. Vision loss in glaucoma is gradual and is often not noticed, since it is in the peripheral vision. Vitamins have no effect on glaucoma.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a very different condition. It’s not clear exactly how the condition starts, but it can be “wet” (with abnormal blood vessels) or “dry” (more common, with atrophy of the macula, the part of the retina in the center where our vision is sharpest). AMD is diagnosed by an eye exam. Wet AMD has treatment options, such as injections into the eye of medications to stop abnormal blood vessels from growing. Dry AMD is treated with the AREDS or AREDS 2 vitamins, which slow progression of the disease.You know all about cataracts, having had surgery. They are opacities in the lens of the eye, causing gradual cloudiness of the vision. If you live long enough, you will develop cataracts. Surgery is the treatment for cataracts.DEAR DR. ROACH: Which type of calcium supplement is best absorbed?  How many milligrams do you suggest for a woman in her 60s? -- D.R.ANSWER: Most calcium supplements sold are either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate, and either one is reasonable in people who need calcium supplementation. I prefer dietary calcium when possible: Calcium supplements increase the risk of kidney stones, while calcium in food (dairy products and fish with tiny bones, such as sardines, are excellent sources) decreases kidney stone risk. Further, there is some suggestion that calcium supplementation may increase heart disease risk, and while the evidence is conflicting, calcium from food seems safer than calcium supplements to me.The standard recommendation is 1,200 mg of elemental calcium a day from a combination of food and supplements for a woman over 50 or a man over 70. (Read labels carefully: A 1,250 mg serving, which may be one or more tablets of calcium carbonate, contains 500 mg of elemental calcium.)

Dear Abby: My friend stood outside of church yelling at me for something I didn’t do,Abigail Van Buren,Advice,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 12:04 a.m.",0,"Dear AbbyNEW!By Abigail Van BurenDEAR ABBY: A friend, “Marie,” approached me in the parking lot after church, raising her voice, flailing her arms and saying three people had told her that I told them to stay away from her and her husband. I told Marie it wasn’t true, and she and her husband were my friends. She reiterated that three people said it, shaking her hand and holding up three fingers in my face.When I asked who they were, she wouldn’t tell me. I asked her if she would get the three people together at her house because I would like to talk to them in person -- she said no to that request, too. I then stated that we were standing on hallowed ground in the church parking lot, and I was telling her the truth. Again, she insisted she heard differently from three people.I was very upset to be accused of a total lie and at Marie’s refusal to believe me. When I suggested we go inside the church and I would put my hands on Jesus’ feet and swear I never said anything about her and her husband, she said she didn’t have time.After I came home from church, I sent a text to the only two friends I had spoken to recently and asked them if I had said anything to them about Marie and her husband. Both replied no. I sent a copy of both texts to Marie so she could read them for herself. I thought it would be another way of showing I am not guilty.How on Earth can I prove I am not guilty if Marie won’t let me talk to the three supposed people or swear on Jesus’ feet that I’m not guilty? What should I do? -- ACCUSED IN IDAHODEAR ACCUSED: Because this unhappy scenario happened on church property, consider discussing it with your religious adviser. Marie’s actions were over the top. Could she have emotional problems you aren’t aware of? If members of the congregation are really carrying nasty and disruptive tales after church as she has asserted, your preacher may want to deliver a sermon soon about “bearing false witness.” You have my sympathy.DEAR ABBY: For many years, my wife and I have donated items to charitable agencies. I have been a blood donor for many years. Sometimes, I get a “thank-you” item, such as a T-shirt with words on it indicating that I donated.I’m not comfortable donating a shirt with such a message. The person who receives it might not be a blood donor. While wearing it, the person might be thanked by someone who sees the shirt. That person wouldn’t have the right to “steal the glory” and puff out his chest. It’s a shame to trash a shirt. Do you have a suggestion as to what I might do with such an item? -- DONATING IN FLORIDADEAR DONATING: Because of your concerns about stolen glory, consider using the T-shirt(s) for house cleaning.

Details trickle out in ‘complex case’ of 4 Idaho students killed in their beds,Tribune News Service,Public Safety,,"Nov. 19, 2022, 9:22 a.m.",0,"This is the off-campus residence where four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in their beds.TNSNEW!By Tribune News ServiceIt’s been days since four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death in an off-campus home, and a lot is still unknown about the attack, but Friday evening authorities released a few additional details.In a Friday Facebook post, the Moscow Police Department said detectives do not believe that two roommates who survived or a man that was seen in a Twitch feed outside a food truck with two of the victims were involved in the crime.Police also said unsubstantiated online reports that the victims were “tied and gagged” are not true.The victims were Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene; Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls; and Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington. They were found dead in a home just behind old Greek row in the 1100 block of King Road. The three female victims lived there with at least two other women.Chapin was dating Kernodle and was staying at the house that night.The four were stabbed to death in their beds and likely were asleep when they were attacked, a county coroner told a cable news channel.Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt also told NewsNation on Thursday that each victim suffered multiple stab wounds from a “pretty large knife.”“It has to be somebody pretty angry in order to stab four people to death,” Mabbutt told NewsNation. The victims were stabbed in the chest and upper body, the coroner said.As information slowly trickles in from the multiple local, state and federal agencies handling the case, so do rumors, misinformation and speculation. Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell told the Idaho Statesman by phone Friday afternoon that authorities do not plan to address specific rumors consistently, but if something specifically contradicts information they have released, they will speak up.“We understand that there is frustration out there, but the length of investigation — most TV shows end in 60 minutes; however, this is a complex case, and it is going to take time,” Snell said.“We won’t address individual rumors, speculations, those types of things, but we will attempt to the best of our ability to provide accurate information and in a timely fashion. With a caveat, though, that sometimes there’s not going to be information that we can provide.”Authorities still have no suspect or motive behind the homicides. Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt has said the four victims were killed with “a large knife,” and the one-page autopsy report ruled the cause of death as “Homicide — Murder.”Police are searching the contents of three dumpsters along King Road for evidence, according to the Friday news release, which also noted that the victims were likely asleep when first attacked and that some of them had defensive wounds. Each student was stabbed multiple times, and there was no indication that any of them were sexually assaulted.The release attributed that information to the coroner.Early Friday afternoon, the Moscow Police Department released a map and timeline of the whereabouts of Mogen, Goncalves, Kernodle and Chapin on Saturday evening and early Sunday before the attack.Throughout the night the students had multiple interactions with many people in the tight-knit college town. Kernodle and Chapin were at a fraternity party at Sigma Chi, while Mogen and Goncalves spent the evening at the Corner Club, a local college bar, and then grabbed food at Grub Truck.The childhood best friends Mogen and Goncalves took an Uber home.Snell confirmed that police have attempted to identify and contact any individuals who may have information about the case. In Friday’s news release, police said that 38 interviews have been conducted and that they have received nearly 500 tips, which are still being “processed, investigated and cleared.”Police still have not said who made the 911 call Sunday at around noon, and Snell declined to identify that person.Snell also said that once someone has been cleared by police and is not a suspect, the public likely would be informed.“I think that’s only fair for those individuals and for the community, so that way they have an idea,” Snell said.The Moscow Police Department is leading the investigation but is being assisted by the Latah County Sheriff’s Office, Idaho State Police and the FBI. There are over 120 law enforcement personnel working on the case.Snell also said there was a dog in the home, and the dog “healthy and fine.” It’s unclear to whom the dog belonged.©2022 Idaho Statesman.

"Hawaii volcano Mauna Loa spews toxic gases, molten lava: What are the risks on the Big Island?",The Associated Press,Environment,,"Nov. 29, 2022, 12:39 p.m.",121,"People watch the glow from lava erupting from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano, Monday, Nov. 28, 2022 in Hilo, Hawaii. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones)APNEW!121sharesBy The Associated PressLava is shooting 100 feet to 200 feet into the air as Hawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupts for the first time in nearly 40 years.For now, lava is not threatening any homes or communities and no evacuation orders have been issued. Lava could eventually reach neighborhoods as it flows downhill though it could take a week or more for molten rock to reach populated areas.Mauna Loa is spewing sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases. They form volcanic smog, or vog, when they mix with vapor, oxygen and dust in sunlight. As a result, state health officials are urging people to cut back on outdoor exercise and other activities that cause heavy breathing.Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Its smaller, more active neighbor, Kilauea volcano, has been erupting continuously for more than a year since September 2021.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA?Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest (that title goes to Mauna Kea) but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass.It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean.Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. The current eruption is its 34th since written history began in 1843.The Big Island is mostly rural and hosts cattle ranches and coffee farms but it is also home to a few small cities, including the county seat of Hilo, which has a population of 45,000.It’s about 200 miles south of Hawaii’s most populous island, Oahu, where the state capital, Honolulu, and beach resort Waikiki are both located.Mauna Loa’s volume is estimated to be at least 18,000 cubic miles, making it the world’s largest volcano when measured from the ocean floor to its summit.IS MAUNA LOA EXPLODING LIKE MOUNT ST. HELENS?Mauna Loa is not exploding like Washington state’s Mount St. Helens did in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles (400 kilometers) away.The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa’s magma tends to be hotter, drier and more fluid. That allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is a shield volcano, named because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA ERUPTING FROM?The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks. Hon expects the current eruption to follow this pattern.The ground is shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating that it could erupt. Scientists say they don't expect that to happen right away but officials on the Big Island of Hawaii are telling residents to be prepared in case it does erupt soon. This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island.APWHAT HAZARDS ARE POSED BY MAUNA LOA’S ERUPTION?-Lava: Molten rock could cover houses, farms or neighborhoods, depending on where it flows. But lava from the northeast rift zone will likely take at least a week to reach populated areas, allowing people time to evacuate if needed.-Volcanic gas: Mauna Loa is releasing volcanic gases, mostly sulfur dioxide. The gases are present in their highest concentrations in the immediate area around the summit crater or vents. But they also combine with other particles to form vog, which can spread across the Big Island and even waft over to the state’s other islands.Vog can give healthy people burning eyes, headaches and sore throats. It can send those with asthma or other respiratory problems to the hospital.-Glass particles: When hot lava erupts from a fissure and rapidly cools, it forms glass particles named “Pele’s hair” and “Pele’s tears” after the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.The particles tend not to travel far from volcanic vents — maybe only a few hundred yards or a mile — and won’t threaten many people, said Aaron Pietruszka, an associate specialist at the University of Hawaii’s Department of Earth Sciences.“It just literally looks like hair strands. And that’s where the fluid lava is stretched by the wind to make long, thin strands,” said Pietruszka.The glass bits — as short as a few millimeters or as long as a few inches — can be sharp.“You wouldn’t want to be digging your hands in it because you could get a cut,” Pietruszka said.An N95 or KF94 mask would protect against these glass particles but not against volcanic gas, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health.“Pele’s hair” specimens from Kilauea volcano’s eruption are visible at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE MAUNA LOA’S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS?Mauna Loa released about 15,000 tons of carbon dioxide per day during its 1984 eruption, according to USGS data.That’s equivalent to the annual emissions from 2,400 sport utility vehicles.Scientists say all of Earth’s volcanoes combined emit less than one percent of the carbon dioxide that humans produce each year.If you purchase a product or register for an account through

"The U.S. promised tribes they would always have fish; they do, but the fish pose toxic risks","Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublica",Native American News,,"Nov. 29, 2022, 8:40 a.m.",201,"Lottie Sam, front right, and other women prepare salmon in Toppenish, Wash., before a ceremony held by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Credit:Tony Schick/OPBNEW!201sharesBy Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublicaThis article was originally published by ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Oregon Public Broadcasting.Salmon heads, fins and tails filled baking trays in the kitchen where Lottie Sam prepped for her tribe’s spring feast.The sacred ceremony, held each year on the Yakama reservation in south-central Washington, honors the first returning salmon and the first gathered roots and berries of the new year.“The only thing we don’t eat is the bones and the teeth, but everything else is sucked clean,” Sam said, laughing.Her mother and grandmother taught her that salmon is a gift from the creator, a source of strength and medicine that is first among all foods on the table. They don’t waste it.“The skin, the brain, the head, the jaw, everything of the salmon,” she said. “Everybody’s gonna have the opportunity to consume that, even if it’s the eyeball.”Sam is a member of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. They are among several tribes with a deep connection to salmon in the Columbia River Basin, a region that drains parts of the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, southward through seven U.S. states into the West’s largest river.Sacred Rivers by The Associated PressIt’s also a region contaminated by more than a century of industrial and agricultural pollution, leaving Sam and others to weigh unknown health risks against sacred practices.“We just know that if we overconsume a certain amount of it that it might have possible risks,” Sam said, as she gutted salmon in the bustling kitchen. “It’s our food. We don’t see it any other way.”But while tribes have pushed the government to pay closer attention to contamination, that hasn’t happened. Regulators have done so little testing for toxic chemicals in fish that even public health and environmental agencies admit they don’t have enough information to prioritize cleanup efforts or to fully inform the public about human health risks.So Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica did our own testing, and we found what public health agencies have not: Native tribes in the Columbia River Basin face a disproportionate risk of toxic exposure through their most important food.OPB and ProPublica purchased 50 salmon from Native fishermen along the Columbia River and paid to have them tested at a certified lab for 13 metals and two classes of chemicals known to be present in the Columbia. We then showed the results to two state health departments, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials and tribal fisheries scientists.The testing showed concentrations of two chemicals in the salmon that the EPA and both Oregon and Washington’s health agencies deem unsafe at the levels consumed by many of the 68,000-plus Native people who are members of tribes living in the Columbia River Basin today. Those chemicals are mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which after prolonged exposure can damage the immune and reproductive systems and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.The general population eats so little fish that agencies do not consider it at risk, which means that government protocols are mostly failing to protect tribal health. In fact, the contaminants pose an unacceptable health risk if salmon is consumed even at just over half the rate commonly reported by tribal members today, according to guidelines from the EPA and Washington Department of Health.The potential for exposure extends along the West Coast, where hundreds of thousands of people face increased risks of cancer and other health problems just by adhering to the salmon-rich diet their cultures were built upon.A spring chinook from the Columbia River at the mouth to the Oregon Washington border. Chinook salmon, like the ones OPB and ProPublica sampled, migrate to sea over the course of their lives, where they pick up contaminants that Northwest waters like the Columbia and other rivers deposit in the ocean. EPA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that even with minimal data available, agency staff members have flagged the potential for exposure to chemicals in salmon caught not just in the Columbia but also Washington’s Puget Sound, British Columbia’s Skeena and Fraser rivers, and California’s Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.Tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding millions of acres but preserving their perpetual right to their “usual and accustomed” fishing areas; the Supreme Court later likened this right to being as important to Native people as the air they breathe.The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River.(Mark Graves/Staff)LC-But time and again, the U.S. has not upheld those treaties. Damming the Columbia River destroyed tribal fishing grounds and, along with habitat loss and overfishing, drove many salmon populations to near extinction, wiping some out entirely. Previous reporting has shown how the federal government failed in its promises to compensate tribes for those losses and in some cases worked against tribes’ efforts to restore salmon populations. In addition, the EPA has allowed cleanups to languish, and state regulators have been slow to rein in industrial pollution. That toxic pollution impairs the ability of salmon to swim, feed and reproduce.Continually poor and declining salmon numbers have prompted the White House to acknowledge an environmental justice crisis in the Columbia River Basin.The results of our testing for toxic chemicals point to yet another failure.A Toxic MysteryQuestions over fish safety go back generations in some tribal families, predating government concerns by decades.Karlen Yallup remembers tribal elders telling her the water had been clean enough to drink at Celilo Falls, their primary fishing site on the Columbia River. Yallup’s great-great-grandparents, members of the Warm Springs tribe, lived near the falls and would fish there every day.Voices

On her relationship with salmon: “My grandma’s grandma … fished all day – gave thanks, treated the salmon with respect. … Then, [the area where they fished] was flooded. It was very devastating to the tribes. … Salmon would face some of the hardest times they would ever face. When the salmon is gone, we are gone.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “So you first start by finely mashing the salmon up, and then you add the beaten eggs into the salmon, and then you salt and pepper it through the whole thing, then you shape the patties and put it in flour, make sure it’s fully covered and put it on the pan.”As the industrial revolution boomed, farming, industry and urban sprawl grew throughout the basin. In 1957, the falls were submerged by water that pooled behind The Dalles Dam — one of 18 built on the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake River, to turn the river into a shipping channel, irrigate farmland and generate hydroelectricity. By then, pollution from those new industries had dirtied the water.Tribal elders told Yallup they knew the water was no longer clean enough to drink when they could see changes and hear differences in the way it ran. They also worried about the health impacts of Hanford, a sprawling nuclear weapons production complex dozens of miles upstream. Hanford became one of dozens of heavily polluted sites across the Columbia basin, considered one of the largest and most expensive toxic cleanups in the world.Yallup said her elders began to suspect that whatever was getting into the water was getting into the fish. They became “very worried about the salmon getting the family sick,” she said.It wasn’t until the 1990s, however, that the government and the broader public drew attention to the risk to people eating those fish.In 1992, despite two decades of improving water quality under the Clean Water Act, an EPA study found chemicals embedded in carp from the Columbia River. The results alarmed the region’s tribes, which responded by working with the agency to test more fish and survey members about their fish consumption rates.Those efforts revealed that tribal people, on average, eat six to 11 times more fish than non-tribal members. They also detected more than 92 different contaminants in the fish, some at levels high enough to harm human health.In the years that followed, EPA staff expressed concerns over toxic contamination in report after report, but little happened in response. The issue officially became an agency priority during the administration of President George W. Bush, but the EPA repeatedly fell short of its goals to clean up toxic sites as responsible parties fought over how much it would cost, who would pay and how quickly it needed to be done.Voices

On his relationship with salmon: “My father and mother taught me how to do this. Same with my grandparents. A long time ago, we cooked on alderwood. We get a stick or something and poke through the salmon, and then we’ll cook it on top of, right next to, a fire.”
How he likes to prepare salmon: “Usually I like it when they make dumplings … and then make ‘em kind of like soup. How I make dumplings usually just get a pot, you can put it like halfway or fill it up all the way with water and once that boils, then you can get canned salmon or smoked salmon and break it up in there. Then you can either put a can of corn or dried corn. … Then once that boils down a little bit, then that’s when I would try to be done with the dough, which is just flour and water. Then you break off pieces into the pot.”The agency also never had the money to fulfill its plans for continuous monitoring, said Mary Lou Soscia, the Columbia River coordinator for the EPA, leaving the agency unable to determine whether the river was getting cleaner.“Nobody wanted to pay attention to toxics,” said Soscia, who has been working on river cleanup since the late 1990s. “But there are small amounts of studies that give us like those yellow blinking lights. And when tribal people eat so much fish, it’s something we have to be really, really concerned about.”A member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs prepares wind-dried salmon the traditional way, inside a drying shack, in September 2021.

Credit:Arya Surowidjojo/OPBFinally, Oregon delivered in 2011 what was hailed as a breakthrough moment: It adopted new water-quality standards to protect tribal people’s health. The state vowed to restrict the amount of chemicals released by industrial facilities and wastewater plants so that people could eat over a third of a pound of fish per day without increasing their risk of health problems. That amount of fish was based on a survey of tribal members done in the 1990s.Other states that share the Columbia River or its tributaries were slow to follow suit. Washington waited a decade to adopt equally protective standards; Idaho and Montana still have not.But while Oregon was ahead of its neighbors, state regulators took few steps to ensure polluters actually met the state’s new limits. For as many as half the contaminants at issue, the state said it didn’t have the technology to measure whether polluters met the new stricter criteria.The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality also said it didn’t have the staff to keep pollution permits updated. It let more than 80% of polluters operate with expired permits, meaning they weren’t even being held to new standards.When asked in September for evidence of how the state’s highly touted standard has actually improved water quality, the DEQ said it “does not have significant amounts of data on the concentration of bioaccumulative pollutants in the Columbia River, and therefore does not have any trend information.”Jennifer Wigal, DEQ’s water quality administrator, said the standards were implemented not because of pollution but to ensure that tribal diets were represented.Voices

On her relationship with salmon: “I don’t think we would be here without this food. … Our parents or grandparents just taught us this way, you know, as we were growing up. … So now it’s a habitual thing. … It’s a delicacy, it has nutrients, it has medicine … and so, even today, in 2022, we’re still going to consume it.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “Canning, I’ve been doing it for a long time so it’s simple to me. … Start with fresh salmon, then I add a little bit of salt and pepper. … It’s best to use a pressure canner. … You cut the salmon to fit in the jars, add the salt and pepper, clean the rim of the jar and make sure there are no cracks or anything, and you have to seal the lid.”Wigal also said that when companies release harmful contaminants into the river, most are at such low concentrations that they are below the agency’s ability to detect them. Additionally, most of the contamination affecting fish, the DEQ said, comes not from those polluters but from runoff and erosion from industries like agriculture and logging.But the DEQ also has yet to curtail that source of pollution. Along the Willamette River, which flows through Oregon’s most populated areas and feeds into the Columbia, the EPA determined last year that the state needed to cut mercury pollution from these sources by at least 88% if it was going to meet its standards for protecting human health.Congress tried to take matters into its own hands, but it fell into the same pattern of bold plans and delayed action. In 2016 it amended the Clean Water Act, the seminal law governing water pollution nationwide, to require the EPA to establish a program dedicated to restoring the Columbia. It took four years and a nudge from the Government Accountability Office for the program to actually begin. That same year, in 2020, an EPA regional staffer found that broad swaths of the river were polluted with toxic chemicals and were below the standards of the Clean Water Act.In an emailed response to questions, the EPA repeatedly said Congress gave the agency orders to clean up the Columbia but failed to provide the agency with funding to carry out the work. Even after the agency designated the Columbia an EPA priority, finally elevating the river to the same status as other major ecosystems like the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, it received no additional funding and staff for cleanup or long-term monitoring.“That needs to happen,” Soscia, the agency’s Columbia River coordinator, said. “It hasn’t happened.”A Disproportionate RiskHad the government followed through on its plans for monitoring, it might have found what OPB and ProPublica’s testing revealed: that contamination was high enough that it would warrant at least one of the state health agencies to recommend eating no more than eight 8-ounce servings of salmon in a month.For non-tribal people, who on average eat less than those eight monthly servings, the risk is minute. But surveys show members of some tribes in the Columbia River Basin on average eat twice as much fish as the agency’s recommended eight monthly servings.The testing also revealed the potential for increased cancer risks from PCBs and another class of chemicals known as dioxins. Given an average Columbia River tribal diet, according to recent surveys commissioned by the EPA, the risk is as much as five times higher than what the EPA considers sufficiently protective of public health. This means that, based on the news organizations’ samples, roughly 1 of every 20,000 people would be diagnosed with cancer as a result of eating the average tribal diet — about 16 servings of fish each month — over the course of a lifetime.The harm goes beyond the raw numbers. That’s because the risk is compounded by exposure from other fish and other toxic chemicals, such as pesticides and flame retardants in those same waters, that weren’t included in OPB and ProPublica’s testing because of cost constraints. Those chemicals are known to accumulate in fish. Beyond fish contamination, tribal populations already experience disproportionately high rates of certain cancers.Public health officials caution that any cancer risks must be weighed against the many health benefits of eating fish, including the potential to lower the risk of heart disease. The Oregon and Washington health departments, like those of many states, do not assess cancer risk when setting public health advisories.We showed the result of our testing to public health officials in both Washington and Oregon. Both groups said they would be taking further steps to assess salmon and the exposure risk to tribes.Emerson Christie, a toxicologist with the Washington Department of Health who analyzed the results, said the department will consider whether to issue an official public health advisory based on the news organizations’ findings. “These results do indicate that there’s a potential for a fish advisory,” Christie said.David Farrer, an Oregon Health Authority toxicologist who also reviewed the results, said the agency would coordinate with state environmental regulators and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission about additional testing or potential advisories.Public health advisories and cooking guidance are a last-resort attempt to protect people when larger cleanup efforts fall short or don’t happen at all.These advisories can also be plagued with delays. When tribes collected and tested tissue from the Pacific lamprey back in 2009, they found that the culturally important eel-like fish contained dangerous levels of mercury and PCBs. The Oregon Health Authority responded by issuing a consumption warning in October — but the process took 13 years.And while advisories put constraints on tribes’ traditional diets, they don’t help with the larger issue: that the waters from which they are eating fish are still contaminated — with no plan to clean them up.“The long-term solution to this problem isn’t keeping people from eating contaminated fish — it’s keeping fish from being contaminated in the first place,” Aja DeCoteau, executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, said when the lamprey advisory was issued.Wilbur Slockish Jr. is a longtime fisherman who serves on the inter-tribal fish commission.It is wrong, Slockish said, for the government to allow pollution and then, instead of cleaning it up, decide it can tell people not to eat the fish they always have.“That’s on the back of our people’s health, the health of the land, the health of the water,” he said. “We’re not disposable.”A Fight Too Big to IgnoreSlockish eats a lot of fish.He relies on stockpiles of jarred, dried or smoked salmon to get him through the winter. He said it’s not uncommon for him to eat more than a pound of salmon or lamprey in one sitting, sometimes multiple times per day.He’s a direct descendant of the Klickitat tribe’s Chief Sla-kish, who signed the Yakama Treaty of 1855, guaranteeing his people’s right to the fish. At that time, studies estimate that, on average, Native people in the region ate five to 10 times more fish than they do today. Slockish is not going to stop eating fish because of warnings about chemical contamination.He doesn’t see the alternatives as any better. Many in his family have struggled with heart disease, diabetes and cancer. He connects it to their being forced away from the river and made to eat government-issued commodity foods full of preservatives.“All of our foods were medicine,” he said. “Because there were no chemicals.”Research across the globe has connected the loss of traditional diets with spikes in health problems for Indigenous populations. In one West Coast tribe, the Karuk of Northern California, researchers found a direct link between families’ loss of access to salmon and increased prevalence of diabetes and heart disease.Public health experts agree that wild salmon, wherever it’s caught, remains one of the healthiest sources of protein available, and that chemicals can also contaminate other foods beyond just fish.Tribal leaders also worry more about their members getting too little fish than too much of it. And because salmon are a primary income source for many tribal fishers, they worry that fears over fish safety will drive away customers.But for Columbia River tribes, fish are also a cultural fixture, present at every ceremony. They are shared as customary gifts. Babies teethe on lamprey tails. Salmon heads and backbones are boiled into medicinal broths for the sick and elderly.Tribes up and down the river continue to fight for their right to a traditional diet and to clean fish.Yallup, from the Warm Springs tribe, decided to become an advocate for salmon after hearing from her grandmothers how much more limited their traditions had become.She’s on track to graduate in December from Portland’s Lewis & Clark Law School. Yallup chose the law profession to fight for salmon, she said, and to change laws to protect the river from pollution.“If I had a choice, I would just be a fisherman. I felt the responsibility to have to leave the reservation and have to go to law school,” Yallup said. “It’s such a big fight now. It’s kind of impossible to ignore.”Earlier this year, tribes successfully lobbied for one of their Columbia River fishing sites just east of Portland, known as Bradford Island, to be added to the list of polluted places eligible for cleanup money from the federal Superfund program.In August, the EPA received $79 million to reduce toxic pollution in the Columbia River as part of President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It is the most money ever dedicated to reducing Columbia River contamination. It’s also a fraction of what tribes and advocates say is needed.The Yakama Nation is using some of that EPA money to lead a pilot study into the kind of long-term monitoring that has been a recognized need for decades.Laura Klasner Shira, an environmental engineer for Yakama Nation Fisheries, said the tribe put together four federal grants to pay for its pilot study, which is limited to the area around Bonneville Dam, east of Portland. They hope someday it could grow to span nearly the entire length of the Columbia, up to the Canadian border. But it took 10 years to get as far as they are now.“It’s disappointing that the tribes have to take on this work,” she said, noting that government agencies not only have treaty and legal responsibilities but better funding. “The tribes have been the strongest advocates with the least resources.”They will sample resident fish, young salmon on their way to the ocean, and adult salmon after they’ve returned.They have two years to finish the work. After that, funding for their monitoring becomes a question mark.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive

Readers respond: Congress should restore expanded child tax credit,Letters to the editor,Opinion,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 6:30 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Letters to the editor | The OregonianThe recent midterm elections saw many voters rejecting extremist candidates and embracing those who really are trying to use government to help their constituents. Although taxes raise money that can be spent on the public good, tax policies always favor some folks more than others.During the height of the pandemic, the expanded Child Tax Credit reduced the child poverty rate by 40%. A simple monthly payment allowed parents to stay home with their kids—or to pay for daycare so that they could go to work. The Niskanen Center supports the child tax credit, and Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimates that its social benefits (lower infant mortality, lower long-term health care costs, more children becoming more productive citizens) outweigh the costs by eight to one. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, has been one of the child tax credit’s strongest supporters. The expanded credit was allowed to lapse, but with the lessons of the midterms in mind the members of Congress now have a chance to restore it.

"Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer to cut inflation, chair says",The Associated Press,Business,,"Nov. 30, 2022, 3:51 p.m.",0,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institute on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022, in Washington.AP Photo/Nathan HowardNEW!By The Associated PressThe Federal Reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period, Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the Fed’s single-minded focus on combating stubborn inflation.Yet in a speech at the Brookings Institution, Powell also signaled that the Fed may increase its key interest rate by a half-point at its December meeting, a smaller boost after four straight three-quarter point hikes. Rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter-point size at its February and March meetings, based on previous Fed forecasts.Powell said the Fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy, hiring, and wage growth, but not so much as to send the U.S. into recession.It has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3.75% to 4%, the highest in 15 years. Those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates, causing home sales to plunge, while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans.“We think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks,” Powell said. “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,” which will take place Dec. 13-14.Financial markets rallied in response to Powell’s suggestion that rate increases will slow. The S&P 500 jumped 122 points, or 3.1%. It had fallen before Powell spoke.But Powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn’t be taken as a sign the Fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon.“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding (interest rates) at a restrictive level for some time,” Powell said. “History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”Powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front, with the cost of goods such as cars, furniture, and appliances in retreat. He also said that rents and other housing costs — which make up about a third of the consumer price index — were likely to decline next year.But the cost of services, which includes dining out, traveling, and health care, are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in, he said.“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,” Powell said.The Fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high. Paychecks, on average, have jumped about 5% in the past year, before inflation, the fastest pace in four decades.“We want wages to go up strongly, but they’ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2% inflation over time,” Powell said. Wage growth at about 3.5% a year would fit that criteria, he said.Slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult, he said, because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon.Fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned, but that hasn’t happened.The lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements, the deaths of several hundred thousand working-age people from COVID-19, and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth, Powell said.With the supply of workers limited, the Fed’s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses’ demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply, he added.Economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate, with the economy potentially falling into recession.But Powell, in remarks during a question-and-answer session, held out hope that employers could cut the near record-high number of job openings they have posted, rather than lay off large numbers of workers.According to a government report earlier Wednesday, businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1.5 million since March, though there are still about 1.7 open jobs for every unemployed worker. That ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff.Still, Powell said that employers could cut those openings further, while engaging in only limited layoffs, as the Fed’s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending.“I do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing ... unemployment goes up, but it’s not a hard landing, it’s not a severe recession,” he said.Last month’s inflation report showed that prices rose 7.7% in October from a year earlier, straining many families’ budgets. That is down, however, from a 9.1% peak in June.Fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending, reduce hiring and wage growth, and cool inflation. Powell said the Fed’s efforts have slowed demand, and will have to keep it slow “for an extended period.”-- The Associated PressIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the

"Hazelwood shooting victim identified, suspect in custody charged with second-degree murder",Savannah Eadens,Public Safety,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 5:12 p.m.",0,"A man was arrested this week in the shooting homicide investigation of Brian Wayne Logan, 52, who was killed Nov. 13 in Southeast Portland.NEW!By Savannah Eadens | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe victim of a shooting homicide in Portland’s Hazelwood neighborhood last month was publicly identified Friday after the man suspected in his death was arrested this week, according to police.Brian Wayne Logan, 52, was found near Southeast 122nd Avenue and Ash Street about 1:30 a.m. on Nov. 13 after officers responded to a shooting. He died at a local hospital from gunshot wound or wounds, the medical examiner later determined.Sometime in the past three weeks, homicide detectives identified a suspect. With an arrest warrant — and the help of special police teams and the U.S. Marshal’s office — they arrested Thomas Nathaniel Tibballl, 24 of Portland on Thursday in the 12000 block of Southeast Ash Street, down the street from where the shooting took place.Tibbell was interviewed by detectives and charged with second-degree murder, unlawful use of a weapon and being a felon in possession of a firearm, but the homicide investigation is not complete, according to a news release from the Portland Police Bureau.According to court records, Tibbell was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon in 2022, identity theft and attempted robbery in 2020 and attempted robbery in 2015. Logan, the victim, was identified in court documents as houseless when he was arrested in October for allegedly trespassing and refusing to leave the Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Northwest Portland. At least 15 other people experiencing homelessness have been killed in Portland this year. With three weeks remaining in the calendar year, 95 people have died by homicide in Portland, most in shootings. The toll has surpassed the year-end total for 2021, which concluded with a record-breaking 92 homicides. -- Savannah Eadens; seadens@oregonian.com; 503-221-6651; @savannaheadensIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",134,"'-221':312 '-6651':313 '1':73 '12000':140 '122nd':67 '13':21,78 '15':257 '2015':222 '2020':217 '2021':298 '2022':210 '24':133 '30':74 '503':311 '52':16,62 '92':306 '95':277 'a.m':75 'accord':57,187 'account':323 'alleg':240 'arrest':4,54,113,129,236 'ash':70,144 'attempt':214,219 'avenu':68 'block':141 'break':305 'brian':13 'bureau.according':196 'calendar':275 'center':251 'charg':160 'compens':335 'complet':186 'conclud':300 'convict':202 'court':198,229 'death':52 'degre':164 'detect':107,158 'determined.sometime':100 'die':86,280 'document':230 'eaden':27,309 'end':295 'examin':98 'experienc':260 'felon':174 'firearm':179 'found':64 'friday':45 'good':248 'gunshot':92 'hazelwood':38 'help':117 'homeless':261 'homicid':10,34,106,182,282,307 'hospit':90 'houseless':232 'ident':211 'identifi':44,108,227 'interview':156 'investig':11,183 'kill':19,264 'last':40 'later':99 'least':256 'leav':245 'legaci':247 'link':328 'local':89 'logan':15,61,223 'man':2,48 'marshal':125 'may':333 'medic':97,250 'month':41 'murder':165 'nathaniel':131 'near':65 'neighborhood':39 'news':190 'northwest':253 'nov':20,77 'octob':238 'offic':80,127 'one':325 'oregonian/oregonlivethe':29 'past':103 'peopl':259,278 'place.tibbell':154 'polic':120,195 'police.brian':59 'portland':36,135,194,254,266,284 'portland.new':24 'possess':176 'product':318 'public':43 'purchas':316 'receiv':334 'record':199,304 'record-break':303 'refus':243 'regist':320 'releas':191 'remain':272 'respond':81 'robberi':215,220 'samaritan':249 'savannah':26,308 'savannaheadensif':314 'seadens@oregonian.com':310 'second':163 'second-degre':162 'shoot':9,33,84,152,287 'site':331 'southeast':23,66,143 'special':119 'street':71,145,148 'surpass':291 'suspect':49,110 'team':121 'theft':212 'thoma':130 'three':104,270 'thursday':137 'tibball':132 'tibbel':200 'toll':289 'took':153 'total':296 'trespass':241 'u.s':124 'unlaw':166,204 'use':167,205 'victim':30,225 'warrant':114 'wayn':14,60 'weapon':170,208 'week':6,56,105,271 'wound':93,95 'year':268,276,294 'year-end':293","{""The Oregonian""}"
New details emerge as testimony opens criminal trial for NW sheriff’s false-reporting case involving Black newspaper carrier,Tribune News Service,Pacific Northwest,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 10:57 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Tribune News ServiceThe 911 dispatcher who answered Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer’s call reporting a threat to his life nearly two years ago feared the county’s top lawman was being targeted when he put out a countywide alert rallying dozens of officers to the scene.“In my perception of what was going on, waiting any amount of time could be a life or death situation,” South Sound 911 dispatcher Conrad Shadel said Thursday from the witness stand of Troyer’s trial on two misdemeanor charges related to false reporting.That’s why Shadel entered a Priority 0 call — reserved for officers in danger and natural disasters — and typed Troyer’s location with a note of “making threats to kill,” within 30 seconds of picking up Troyer’s phone call on Jan. 27, 2021, Shadel said. He didn’t want to wait for more information before alerting officers.The Priority 0 call put out a loud beeping sound over the radio that told officers countywide to clear the airwaves and listen for critical information, according to witness testimony. Two pairs of Tacoma police officers rushed to Troyer’s location in their patrol cars with lights and sirens activated.Troyer’s call last year to an emergency dispatcher saying a Black newspaper carrier was threatening to kill him — a claim a Tacoma police report said he walked back upon questioning — provoked widespread criticism and calls for his resignation.It led Troyer to be placed on a prosecutor’s list of officers with credibility issues. An investigation by a former U.S. attorney found his conduct violated bias-free policing and professional standards. Now, the trial will determine if it was a crime.An officer from each of those patrol cars also testified during Troyer’s trial Thursday. Corey Ventura has since become an officer in Texas. Prosecutors from the state Attorney General’s Office called in Aaron Baran on his way to work for TPD.Baran told jurors that he drew his gun at a ready position when he approached the car of newspaper carrier Sedrick Altheimer, a then-24-year-old Black man, who Troyer reported threatened to kill him. Ventura said his partner at the time, Chad Lawless, also drew his gun and held it at chest height.Lawless is the officer who interviewed Troyer and wrote a report the following day stating the sheriff told him he was never threatened. It is unclear when Lawless and Altheimer will testify.Defense attorneys Anne Bremner and Nick Gross of the Seattle-based law firm Frey Buck devoted much of their questioning witnesses Thursday to distancing Troyer from the dispatcher’s decision to enter a Priority 0 call and minimizing the intensity of the police response it garnered.Troyer plans to testify that he never retracted his statement about Altheimer threatening him, according to defense attorneys.Bremner, a regular legal analyst on cable news, asked all three witnesses who testified to count up how many officers arrived at the scene.“This is important,” Bremner told Shadel when he said he’d have to analyze a multi-page dispatch log to give her an accurate number.Shadel said 40 officers were headed to Troyer prior to TPD officers at the scene downgrading the call around 2:11 a.m., about five minutes after the sheriff’s call. A dispatch log showed five officers were at the scene at that point, Shadel testified. At least 10 arrived in all.Attorneys excused Shadel and Ventura as witnesses, but the defense team wanted the opportunity to recall Baran later in the trial. Court proceedings will resume on Monday morning.If convicted, each of the two misdemeanor charges against Troyer would carry penalties of up to a year in jail and up to a $5,000 fine. Only a felony conviction automatically removes an elected official from office under state law.Tacoma officers testify about Troyer emergency responseVentura, who left TPD in May for a policing job in Southlake, Texas, was the prosecution’s first witness. Several observers from the public were in the courtroom.After hearing the Priority 0 call on his radio from a north side substation, Ventura said, “immediately we ran to our patrol car and started responding to the call.”Ventura drove and his partner of the last year, Lawless, gave updates from their car’s computer monitor. They learned en route that the officer whose life was reportedly threatened was Troyer.Prosecutors played Ventura’s body-worn camera footage for jurors. Lawless forgot his camera at the substation.Ventura and Lawless parked behind Altheimer’s sedan, which was nose-to-nose with Troyer’s Chevy Tahoe. They were the first police at the scene.“Both of them could have backed up,” Ventura said when asked by defense attorneys about vehicles being blocked in.Ventura approached Altheimer’s rolled-down window while Lawless drew his gun. They inferred based on Troyer’s report that Altheimer could be a threat to responding officers.“He appeared agitated, he was verbally yelling,” Ventura said. Before Ventura could explain why they were called, Altheimer began “saying that the reason we’re there is because he was a Black man in a white neighborhood. He was trying to explain his side.”As Ventura got closer to Altheimer’s car, he testified he saw newspapers in the vehicle, matching his story about being a delivery driver. Ventura patted down Altheimer’s pockets for weapons and detained him for questioning, though he wasn’t handcuffed.Baran and his partner, Zachary Hobbs, stopped behind Troyer and approached Altheimer from the opposite side of Lawless and Ventura. Baran said he drew his gun to cover Ventura and continued to assess Altheimer as a threat while the other officer spoke with him.Baran has been with TPD since the summer of 2018 and before that worked as a Mason County deputy.Prior to Troyer’s call, he and Hobbs had been on the north side of Tacoma investigating a flashing light in an apartment complex due to concerns it was a fire alarm. Then Baran heard the Priority 0 beeps on his radio. Hobbs drove them to the scene. They learned it was Troyer who needed help on their way.Ventura said Altheimer calmed down as he explained the reasoning for the police response. Meanwhile, Lawless went to interview Troyer.Altheimer told Ventura that Troyer lied about the threat to his life, according to video footage.“I’m not going to blow smoke up your ass and say anything is going to be done about it,” Ventura said when Altheimer asked if anything would happen to the sheriff if his threat report was false. In his experience, Ventura testified police rarely take action on false reports.Ventura and Lawless left around 2:40 a.m. after deciding to let Altheimer go.“We determined through our investigation that no crime was committed and he could leave,” Ventura said.About two hours after Troyer’s first call, around 4:04 a.m., Ventura and Lawless were again dispatched to Troyer’s house for a report that a newspaper was launched at his house, Ventura testified. He looked for evidence that a paper was thrown “maliciously” but only saw one lying in the driveway.“I made the determination that we were not going to investigate further,” Ventura said. “Launching of a newspaper is not a crime.”Bremner told Ventura during questioning that Troyer had reported to a TPD supervisor that Altheimer returned to his house, revved his engine, yelled and threw a newspaper.In the weeks and months after responding to the call, some of the officers who were at the scene aired their grievances in a group chat, Baran said. He turned over 12 pages of text messages in response to a subpoena.The defense asked Baran about two texts he sent: one where he called Troyer a “douchebag,” and another where he seemed to mimic a fighting video game announcer: “Troyer v. Lawless. Round 2. Fight.”Defense attorneys said during opening statements that Lawless also sent text messages disparaging Troyer.“There’s a level of frustration getting involved in a (high profile) situation like this” based on the sheriff’s actions, said Baran, explaining the thinking behind his texts.Troyer’s call taker testifiesShadel, who has been a dispatcher with South Sound 911 for about seven years, said he was alarmed when Troyer reported that the person threatening him knew who he was.“In my mind, I’m imagining someone looking for him or sitting outside his house stalking him,” Shadel said.The majority of the time officers ring the direct line to dispatchers, it’s a casual call, Shadel said. He gave examples of calling in sick or giving a roster of officers on duty.Shadel said he had never experienced an officer asking for help on the direct line.When Troyer called, Shadel said his voice was familiar. He had previously spoken to Troyer a few times about high-profile incidents while Troyer worked as the department’s spokesperson for the 20-some years prior to his election.Prosecutors played Troyer’s nearly five-minute call with Shadel for jurors.Shadel said Troyer spoke calmly about the incident, but officers are trained to keep an even tone for effective communication, as are dispatchers.“They are constantly in stressful situations so the tone of their voice does not reflect what’s actually happening,” Shadel said.Shadel said he was worried Troyer was downplaying the incident when he asked for only one or two officers to respond. Dispatchers are warned that police have a habit of understating the severity of a situation, he said.“My understanding was there was some sort of active confrontation going on,” Shadel said, but he was confused about exactly what was happening.Bremner pressed Shadel about why he didn’t enter into a computer dispatch system that Troyer only wanted a couple of officers to come.“At the moment my concern was his immediate safety,” said Shadel, adding that there was other information he didn’t enter into the system for officers to read.Shadel conceded that Troyer’s request was important context that he should have provided to officers.Bremner also emphasized that it was Shadel’s decision to enter Troyer’s call as Priority 0.“I was concerned that he was in danger,” Shadel responded.___(c)2022

"Record number of firs dying in Oregon, Washington in what experts call ‘Firmageddon’",Nathan Gilles,Environment,,"Nov. 25, 2022, 12:07 p.m.",0,"Fir trees across Oregon are dying from a combination of drought,  insects and fungal diseases.Ardeshir Tabrizian/The Oregonian (file)NEW!By Nathan Gilles | Columbia InsightFir trees in Oregon and Washington died in record-breaking numbers in 2022, according to as-yet unpublished research conducted by the U.S. Forest Service.Called “Firmageddon” by researchers, the “significant and disturbing” mortality event is the largest die-off ever recorded for fir trees in the two states.In total, the Forest Service observed fir die-offs occurring on more than 1.23 million acres (over 1,900 square miles) in Oregon and Washington.Oregon, however, was the hardest hit. The Forest Service observed dead firs on roughly 1.1 million acres (over 1,700 square miles) of forest in Oregon alone. This year’s numbers for the state are nearly double the acres recorded during previous die-offs.Heavily affected areas include the Fremont, Winema, Ochoco and Malheur National Forests.The most southerly of the forests, the Fremont National Forest, was the hardest hit, according to survey data.“We’re calling it ‘Firmageddon,’” Daniel DePinte, who led the survey for the USFS Pacific Northwest Region Aerial Survey, told a gathering of colleagues in October. “It is unprecedented, the number of acres we have seen impacted. It’s definitely significant and it’s disturbing.”Fatal factorsIn an interview with Columbia Insight, DePinte says although his team’s results are preliminary and further analysis is needed, the 2022 Firmageddon appears to be due to a combination of drought coupled with insects and fungal diseases working together to weaken and kill trees.Extreme heat, including last year’s record-breaking “heat dome,” is also being investigated as a possible cause.“When a drought event comes around it basically weakens the entire forest to a point where the insects and the diseases start to work in tandem and this pushes a tree over the edge and it succumbs to mortality,” says DePinte.What’s noteworthy about Firmageddon isn’t just the total area impacted. It’s the number of dead trees within that space.In some areas as much as 50% or more of fir trees are estimated to have died.These “severe” die-off’s occurred in central Oregon in forests running from the Oregon/California border northward, according to survey data.Survey methodSurveys of forests were conducted using a combination of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, drones and satellite imagery.The surveys were primarily conducted, as they have been for decades, using an airplane flying 1,000 feet over forested land.DePinte and his team surveyed forests on federal, state and private lands, adding up to a total of roughly 69 million acres (over 100,000 square miles) in Oregon and Washington.Small sections of California and Idaho, where national forests spill over the state borders, were also surveyed.The Oregon Department of Forestry and Washington Department of Natural Resources also participated in the effort.Although fir die-offs have been recorded as far back as 1952, when surveys began, this year’s Firmageddon dwarfs all previous records.The USFS did not conduct aerial surveys in 2020 due to social-distancing rules around Covid-19.Which fir species impacted?Firmageddon, as the researchers define it, appears to be limited to so-called “true fir” trees; trees in the genus Abies.The Pacific Northwest’s leading timber crop, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), is not in the genus Abies and is not considered to be a true fir.Die-offs were recorded for grand fir, white fir, red fir, noble fir and the hybrid Shasta red fir.The largest mortality was observed at lower elevations where grand fir and white fir are plentiful.White fir was the hardest hit species, according to survey data.Doug fir die-offAlthough true firs are experiencing their worst die-off on record, Douglas fir is having a die-off of its own, though on a comparatively smaller scale.The USFS survey estimates that 450,000 acres (over 700 square miles) of Douglas fir have experienced some level of mortality in Oregon with the majority of this occurring in southwestern Oregon.Washington is also seeing a die-off of Douglas fir with roughly 230,000 acres (nearly 360 square miles) impacted.The level of Douglas fir die-off within the areas affected isn’t considered “severe.” The USFS defines “severe” as 50% or more of the trees within an area having died.However, the extent of the die-off in terms of total area is concerning, according to DePinte.“It [the Douglas fir die-off] is on the lighter side,” says DePinte. “The problem is the extent. When you’re up in a plane flying over and you see that it goes on for the entire mountain side, then it’s like, ‘Whoa! That’s a huge amount of dead trees.’”What’s really unusual, according to DePinte, is the insects that are believed to be causing the Douglas fir die-off are considered to be “secondary agendas.”The insects have the ability to kill trees that are already weakened by drought or extreme heat events, but generally can’t kill the trees on their own.“They can kill trees, but they’re not ‘tree killers,’” says DePinte.The USFS will continue monitoring the Douglas fir die-off and will meet with researchers at Oregon State University in the coming weeks to study the issue further.Although more analysis is required, drought appears to be weakening Douglas fir trees, making them susceptible to insect and possibly also fungal attack.This also appears to be the mechanism affecting true firs.Insects, fungi compound problems“I think it’s sort of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ kind of thing,” says Robbie Flowers, a USFS etymologist, about the likely cause of the fir die-off.Firmageddon has not one cause but multiple compounding causes, according to Flowers.Flowers, who conducted on-the-ground surveys of tree mortality to, in effect, “ground truth” the aerial survey data, says a clear relationship between drought and fir die-offs has been observed historically—droughts tend to lead to fir die-offs.When drought occurs, says Flowers, fir trees become susceptible to pests.The pests implicated in Firmageddon are the fir engraver beetle (Scolytus ventralis), a type of bark beetle; and multiple fungal root diseases.Various parasitic fungi can make fir roots less able to absorb water. This makes the trees more susceptible to drought conditions.Firs with root disease are also more susceptible to insect attacks, especially from the fir engraver beetle, which gets its name because it burrows and carves up the water-rich cambium layer of a tree just under the bark.The fir tree’s only defense against this attack in its cambium layer is to flush the insects out with pitch. But if drought and root diseases make water less available, the trees can’t amount a defense.As a consequence, says Flowers, a large enough fir engraver infestation can effectively “girdle” an already water-stressed fir tree.“The trees have a limited amount of resources they can put into defense and they’re defenses go down then they get into these stressful situations,” says Flowers.Drought’s fingerprintThat drought is very likely weakening fir trees and making them susceptible to infections isn’t surprising.According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Oregon and Washington have been in some form of drought since the early 2000s.The recent dieback of western red cedars has also been linked to drought by area researchers. (A dieback occurs when a tree or other plant begins to die from the tip of its leaves or roots inward. Unlike die-offs, which count dead trees, diebacks count dead, dying and sick trees.)While observed on redcedars experiencing dieback, biotic factors like insects and fungi were estimated by researchers to be secondary to drought as the leading cause of tree illness and death.The spread of fir die-off and the spread of drought in Oregon match closely.In fact, DePinte notes, those areas of Oregon that have been especially hard hit with “extreme” and “exceptional drought” (as defined by the Drought Monitor) are the same areas where his team observed the largest die-offs of firs.Increased risk of wildfireUnsurprisingly, having more than half the fir trees dead in some of these forests poses a major fire risk.A dangerous fire period can occur within the first two years following a major die-off, says DePinte.During these critical first two years, dead trees continue to hold onto their dried-out needles in the canopy of the forest.This makes severe crown fires far more likely should a fire start.When this happens fire can jump from treetop to treetop, leading to large scale destruction.“It [wildfire] can just go from tree to tree, not even touching the ground hardly, and just burn the entire canopy,” says DePinte. “That is the worst fire there is. It’s the most dangerous and hardest to control.”Nathan Gilles is a freelance science writer based in Vancouver, Washington.##Columbia Insight, based in Hood River, Oregon, is nonprofit news site

Online sleuths in stabbing deaths of 4 Idaho students seek answers to key questions,The Associated Press,Public Safety,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 7:40 a.m.",0,"FILE - The moon rises on Nov. 29, 2022, as a Moscow police officer stands guard in his vehicle at the home where four University of Idaho students were found dead on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe deaths of four University of Idaho students nearly three weeks ago has riled up thousands of would-be armchair sleuths, many of whom are posting speculation and unfounded rumors about the fatal stabbings online.Relatively few details have been released in the horrific case that has left the small town of Moscow stunned and grieving for Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.The unanswered questions are fueling extensive interest in details about what happened. Here is a look at what is known about the killings, and what remains a mystery:IS THERE A SUSPECT?The Moscow Police Department has not yet named a suspect or made any arrests. Investigators have also not yet found a weapon, the department wrote in a news release Wednesday. Autopsies determined the four students were stabbed to death, likely with a fixed-blade knife, and investigators checked with local stores to see if any had sold military-style knives recently.FILE - People attending a vigil for the four University of Idaho students who were killed on Nov. 13, 2022, hold up their phones during a moment of silence on Nov. 30, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation.(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APWHO WERE THE VICTIMS?All four were friends and members of the university’s Greek system. Xana Kernodle, 20, was a junior studying marketing. She was from Post Falls, Idaho, and joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority on campus. She lived at the rental home with the other two women who were stabbed, and she was dating Ethan Chapin, who was visiting the night of the killings.Chapin, also 20, was from Mount Vernon, Washington and was a triplet. His brother and sister also attend UI, and both Chapin and his brother were members of the Sigma Chi fraternity.Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were both 21 and friends who grew up together in northern Idaho. Mogen worked with Kernodle at a local Greek restaurant in Moscow. She was also a member of Pi Beta Phi.Goncalves was a senior majoring in general studies, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority and was planning a trip to Europe next year.WERE THE VICTIMS TARGETED?It’s unclear whether the killer or killers knew the victims. Police and the county prosecutor’s office have released confusing — and at times contradictory — statements about whether the victims were “targeted.”On Thursday, the police department issued this statement: “We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants.”Investigators say nothing appears to have been stolen from the home.WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT AND MORNING OF THE ATTACK?Goncalves and Mogen went to a local bar, stopped at a food truck and then caught a ride home with a private party around 1:56 a.m., according to a police timeline of the evening.Chapin and Kernodle were at the Sigma Chi house — just a short walk away — and returned to Kernodle’s house around 1:45 a.m., police said.Two other roommates who live in the home were also out that evening, but returned home by 1 a.m., police said. They didn’t wake up until later that morning.After they woke up, they called friends to come to the house because they believed one of the victims found on the second floor had passed out and wasn’t waking up. At 11:58 a.m., someone inside the home called 911, using a roommate’s cell phone. Multiple people talked with the dispatcher before police arrived.Police found two of the victims on the second floor of the three-story home, and two on the third floor. A dog was also at the home, unharmed.Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault, police said.HAS ANYONE BEEN CLEARED?Police say that neither the two surviving roommates nor anyone who was at the home during the 911 call are believed to be involved with the attack. Police also say some of the people seen out with Goncalves and Mogen, including the person who drove them home, are not believed to be involved.A sixth person is also listed on the rental lease for the house, police revealed Thursday, but detectives do not believe that person was at home during the attack.FILE - Officers investigate the deaths of four University of Idaho students at an apartment complex south of campus on Nov. 14, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP, File)APARE OTHER AGENCIES HELPING WITH THE INVESTIGATION?A lot of manpower and resources have been focused on the investigation. Idaho Gov. Brad Little has made $1 million in emergency funding available for the investigation.The Moscow Police Department has four detectives and dozens of officers on the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has assigned more than 40 agents, with about half stationed in Moscow. The Idaho State Police has roughly 20 investigators assisting, and several troopers patrolling the town.IS THERE ANY THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY?Police initially said there was no threat to the community, then later walked back that statement. Because the killer (or killers) is unknown, and because whether the attack was “targeted” is hazy, many in the community are fearful.The University of Idaho has allowed students to switch to fully remote learning, and Dean of Students Blaine Eckles said Wednesday that less than half of the students left campus in favor of online classes.The university has also hired an additional security firm to help with campus safety. Students can request escorts while on campus.DID ANY OF THE VICTIMS RAISE SECURITY CONCERNS BEFORE THE ATTACKS?Neither the university nor the police department have said whether any of the students reported unusual activity or expressed safety concerns in the months or weeks before the attack.The police department has looked into reports that Goncalves may have had a stalker, but despite pursuing hundreds of tips, has been unable to verify that claim, according to a "" Frequently Asked Questions "" document released by the department.WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE PERSON? OR SO-AND-SO?Rumors, speculation and unfounded theories abound online, many targeting people that police have already said aren’t involved in the crime.“There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,” the police department wrote in a Facebook post Thursday evening. “We encourage referencing official releases for accurate information and updated progress.”Police frequently hold back some information about criminal cases because releasing it could harm the investigation. Sometimes crucial evidence doesn’t become publicly known until after an arrest is made and the case goes to trial.Detectives are looking for tips, surveillance videos from the area and other information that could provide context about the killings. They are asking that people call or email the police department with tips and upload any digital media to a special FBI website.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the

San Francisco will allow police to deploy robots that kill,The Associated Press,Public Safety,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 8:28 a.m.",206,"San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott answers questions during a news conference May 2019. (Eric Risberg, Associated Press file photo)NEW!206sharesBy The Associated PressSupervisors in San Francisco voted Tuesday to give city police the ability to use potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations -- following an emotionally charged debate that reflected divisions on the politically liberal board over support for law enforcement.The vote was 8-3, with the majority agreeing to grant police the option despite strong objections from civil liberties and other police oversight groups. Opponents said the authority would lead to the further militarization of a police force already too aggressive with poor and minority communities.Supervisor Connie Chan, a member of the committee that forwarded the proposal to the full board, said she understood concerns over use of force but that “according to state law, we are required to approve the use of these equipments. So here we are, and it’s definitely not a easy discussion.”The San Francisco Police Department said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.“Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives,” she said.Supervisors amended the proposal Tuesday to specify that officers could use robots only after using alternative force or de-escalation tactics, or concluding they would not be able to subdue the suspect through those alternative means. Only a limited number of high-ranking officers could authorize use of robots as a deadly force option.San Francisco police currently have a dozen functioning ground robots used to assess bombs or provide eyes in low visibility situations, the department says. They were acquired between 2010 and 2017, and not once have they been used to deliver an explosive device, police officials said.But explicit authorization was required after a new California law went into effect this year requiring police and sheriffs departments to inventory military-grade equipment and seek approval for their use.The state law was authored last year by San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu while he was an assembly member. It is aimed at giving the public a forum and voice in the acquisition and use of military-grade weapons that have a negative effect on communities, according to the legislation.A federal program has long dispensed grenade launchers, camouflage uniforms, bayonets, armored vehicles and other surplus military equipment to help local law enforcement.In 2017, then-President Donald Trump signed an order reviving the Pentagon program after his predecessor, Barack Obama, curtailed it in 2015, triggered in part by outrage over the use of military gear during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown.San Francisco police said late Tuesday that no robots were obtained from military surplus, but some were purchased with federal grant money.Like many places around the U.S., San Francisco is trying to balance public safety with treasured civilian rights such as privacy and the ability to live free of excessive police oversight. In September, supervisors agreed to a trial run allowing police to access in real time private surveillance camera feeds in certain circumstances.Debate on Tuesday ran more than two hours with members on both sides accusing the other of reckless fear mongering.Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who voted in favor of the policy authorization, said he was troubled by rhetoric painting the police department as untrustworthy and dangerous.“I think there’s larger questions raised when progressives and progressive policies start looking to the public like they are anti-police,” he said. “I think that is bad for progressives. I think it’s bad for this Board of Supervisors. I think it’s bad for Democrats nationally.”Board President Shamann Walton, who voted against the proposal, pushed back, saying it made him not anti-police, but “pro people of color.”“We continuously are being asked to do things in the name of increasing weaponry and opportunities for negative interaction between the police department and people of color,” he said. “This is just one of those things.”The San Francisco Public Defender’s office sent a letter Monday to the board saying that granting police “the ability to kill community members remotely” goes against the city’s progressive values. The office wanted the board to reinstate language barring police from using robots against any person in an act of force.On the other side of the San Francisco Bay, the Oakland Police Department has dropped a similar proposal after public backlash.The first time a robot was used to deliver explosives in the U.S. was in 2016, when Dallas police sent in an armed robot that killed a holed-up sniper who had killed five officers in an ambush.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",127,"'-3':69 '2010':324 '2015':467

Bend police reports reveal shock from those who knew Safeway shooter,Zack Demars,Public Safety,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 6:49 p.m.",0,"Police released documents on Thursday related to the fatal shooting in the Safeway at the  Forum Shopping Center in Bend.Dave Killen/The OregonianNEW!By Zack Demars | Bend BulletinInterviews spread across hundreds of pages of police reports that followed the deadly shooting at a Bend Safeway this summer detail the shock that washed over the gunman’s family and friends in the days that followed.A cache of investigatory documents released by the Bend Police Department on Thursday outlines the scope of the department’s investigation into what led up to Aug. 28, when Ethan Miller entered the grocery store, killed Glen Bennett and Donald Surrett Jr. in the store and took his own life as police arrived.Beyond the horrific details of store customers hiding in a walk-in deli cooler and employees arming themselves with wine bottles, notes taken by investigators show who the shooter left behind in his own life: Family members who knew he had some anger problems but “believed (he) had that all figured out” and a group of friends who bonded over their shared interests in guns.“(One friend) explained that what (the shooter) had done completely betrayed their trust and expectation,” an officer wrote in one report.In most of the interviews, people who had known the shooter expressed shock at what he had done. Some remembered him as willing to “fight for anyone at anytime,” while others said he would threaten people when provoked. Some remembered him as having bullied others at school, while some remembered him having been the victim of bullying.The Bulletin is not identifying the individuals quoted by police to protect their privacy and also is minimizing use of the shooter’s name in line with journalistic best practice.One of the reports details the moment a friend of the shooter’s approached police officers on the scene and expressed concern that the shooter had locked himself in his apartment after sending the friend a text that “was the equivalent to a suicide note.”The friend didn’t know at the time that the shooter was dead in the Safeway nearby.“(The friend) told me he wanted to kick (the shooter’s) door in to make sure he was safe, but wanted to talk to an officer first,” an officer wrote in the report.The friend went on to describe to the officer the guns that the shooter owned.Hours earlier, the shooter’s mother had seen him for the last time. She described to an officer how the shooter spoke to his little brother shortly before the shooting, asking to have their apartment to himself because a girl was coming over.“While the little brother was walking back to a friend’s house from getting food, he heard the gunshots,” an officer wrote, summarizing an interview with the shooter’s family. “They couldn’t believe what had happened and are grieving as well.”The police reports leave many questions about the shooting unanswered. Most of all: Why did it all happen?Sheila Miller, a spokesperson for the police department unrelated to the shooter, said the three-month investigation did not establish a clear motive behind why the gunman opened fire on Safeway. She acknowledged that among the most concrete evidence of his motive was a hate-filled manifesto the shooter appeared to have posted online prior to the shooting.The department was primarily focused on the facts of what happened that night and whether anybody else needed to be held accountable, Sheila Miller said.“Our role is to investigate what happened and who is responsible and try to ensure justice as best we can,” Sheila Miller told The Bulletin. “Why the suspect chose to shoot people in the grocery store, we may never know. We may never know what was going through his mind.”In other reports, officers describe conversations with the shooter’s friends about their shared interests in guns. A group of them would go shooting at Mayfield Pond, but most of them hadn’t seen the shooter in several months.Even though they liked to shoot together, the friends expressed disbelief at what the shooter had done.One told officers, “his group did not like these events because they ruined the gun community,” an apparent reference to the impact of mass shootings on debates about gun regulation.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",143,"'28':90 'account':577,723 'acknowledg':530 'across':29 'also':272 'among':532 'anger':158 'anybodi':571 'anyon':227 'anytim':229 'apart':316,428 'appar':702 'appear':548 'approach':299 'arm':132 'arrived.beyond':115 'ask':424 'aug':89 'back':443 'behind':146,521 'believ':161,470 'bend':26,43,71 'bend.dave':20 'bennett':100 'best':285,598 'betray':191 'bond':174 'bottl':136 'brother':419,440 'bulletin':258,605 'bulletininterview':27 'bulli':244 'bullying.the':257 'cach':64 'center':18 'chose':609 'clear':519 'come':435 'communiti':700 'compens':735 'complet':190 'concern':307 'concret':535 'convers':636 'cooler':129 'couldn':468 'custom':121 'day':61 'dead':39,343 'debat':711 'deli':128 'demar':25 'depart':73,81,504,557 'describ':385,408,635 'detail':47,118,290 'didn':333 'disbelief':679 'document':3,67 'donald':102 'done':189,218 'done.one':685 'door':359 'earlier':395 'els':572 'employe':131 'ensur':595 'enter':94 'equival':326 'establish':517 'ethan':92 'event':694 'evid':536 'expect':195 'explain':183 'express':212,306,678 'fact':563 'famili':56,151,466 'fatal':9 'fight':225 'figur':166 'fill':544 'fire':526 'first':374 'focus':560 'follow':37 'followed.a':63 'food':451 'forum':16 'friend':58,172,182,294,320,332,349,381,446,641,677 'get':450 'girl':433 'glen':99 'go':627,653 'griev':476 'groceri':96,615 'group':170,649,689 'gun':180,390,647,699,713 'gunman':54,524 'gunshot':455 'hadn':662 'happen':473,496,566,587 'hate':543 'hate-fil':542 'heard':453 'held':576 'hide':122 'horrif':117 'hous':448 'hundr':30 'identifi':261 'impact':706 'individu':263 'interest':178,645 'interview':205,461 'investig':83,140,514,585 'investigatori':66 'journalist':284 'jr':104 'justic':596 'kick':355 'kill':98 'killen/the':21 'knew':154 'know':335,620,624 'known':209 'last':405 'leav':482 'led':86 'left':145 'life':112,150 'like':672,692 'line':282 'link':728 'littl':418,439 'lock':312 'make':362 'mani':483 'manifesto':545 'mass':708 'may':618,622,733 'mayfield':656 'member':152 'miller':93,498,579,602 'mind':630 'minim':274 'moment':292 'month':513 'months.even':669 'mother':399 'motiv':520,539 'name':280 'nearbi':347 'need':573 'never':619,623 'night':568 'note':137,330 'offic':197,301,373,376,388,411,457,634,687 'one':181,200,725 'onlin':552 'open':525 'oregoniannew':22 'other':231,245 'outlin':76 'owned.hours':394 'page':32 'peopl':206,236,612 'polic':1,34,72,114,266,300,480,503 'pond':657 'post':551 'practice.one':286 'primarili':559 'prior':553 'privaci':270 'problem':159 'product':718 'protect':268 'provok':238 'purchas':716 'question':484 'quot':264 'receiv':734 'refer':703 'regist':720 'regulation.if':714 'relat':6 'releas':2,68 'rememb':220,240,250 'report':35,289,481,633 'report.in':201 'report.the':380 'respons':591 'role':582 'ruin':697 'safe':366 'safeway':13,44,346,528 'said':232,509,580 'scene':304 'school':247 'scope':78 'seen':401,664 'send':318 'sever':668 'share':177,644 'sheila':497,578,601 'shock':49,213 'shoot':10,40,423,487,611,654,674,709 'shooter':144,187,211,278,297,310,341,357,393,397,414,464,508,547,639,666,683 'shooting.the':556 'shop':17 'short':420 'show':141 'site':731 'spoke':415 'spokesperson':500 'spread':28 'store':97,107,120,616 'suicid':329 'summar':459 'summer':46 'sure':363 'surrett':103 'suspect':608 'taken':138 'talk':370 'text':322 'though':670 'threaten':235 'three':512 'three-month':511 'thursday':5,75 'time':338,406 'togeth':675 'told':350,603,686 'took':109 'tri':593 'trust':193 'unansw':488 'unrel':505 'use':275 'victim':255 'walk':126,442 'walk-in':125 'want':353,368 'wash':51 'well':478 'went':382 'whether':570 'will':223 'wine':135 'would':234,652 'wrote':198,377,458 'zack':24","{""Bend Bulletin""}"
Conservation group asks Oregon to revoke approvals for renewable diesel refinery on Columbia River,Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive,Business,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",124,"A rendering of the proposed renewable diesel refinery at Port Westward industrial park outside Clatskanie.NEW!124sharesBy Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLiveConservationists this week asked Oregon regulators to revoke state authorizations for a $2 billion-plus renewable diesel refinery proposed on the Columbia River near Clatskanie.Columbia Riverkeeper, which opposes siting the controversial renewable diesel refinery in the Columbia River estuary, argues that approval of the project should be called into question following a key decision in October by the state Land Use Board of Appeals.Columbia County commissioners in February approved land use permits for the project’s backer, Houston-based NEXT Renewables. But conservation groups and a local resident appealed that decision to the state land board, which ruled in late October that a proposed rail yard at the facility is not allowed on agricultural land, as planned.Columbia Riverkeeper is now arguing that the land use decision undercuts an air quality permit for the facility that the Department of Environmental Quality approved in August and a previously granted exemption from obtaining a site permit from the Department of Energy. Both of those are predicated on having land use approval from the county, so Columbia Riverkeeper believes they should be revoked.Michael Hinrichs, a spokesperson for the projects’ backers, Houston-based NEXT Renewables, said Columbia Riverkeeper is wrong. NEXT Renewables obtained two separate land use approvals from the county – one for the rail yard and another for the refining facility. The air quality permit is linked to the refinery not the rail yard, he said, so is not impacted by the land use decision.NEXT Renewables will redesign the rail yard so it conforms with land use laws and reapply for a new approval from the county, he added.“Columbia Riverkeeper’s claims are either disingenuous or simply uninformed,” Hinrichs said in an email.He pointed to a memo that DEQ Interim Director Leah Feldman sent to members of the Environmental Quality Commission in advance of the policy setting board’s regular meeting in mid-November that said the land use decision “does not affect” the air permit.Columbia Riverkeeper said it’s aware of the agency’s position, but believes it’s wrong.Dan Serres, conservation director for the group, said the rail facility is an integral part of the project, required for the delivery of feedstocks and other refinery supplies. The air permit, he said, lists the proposed rail activities as a source of emissions. Moreover, in a request for information to the company for another major permit, a water quality certification, DEQ said that consistency with land use regulations would require approvals for both the rail yard and refinery.“Bottom line: the refinery can’t operate without the rail yard,” Serres said in an email. “A company should not receive air or water permits in a situation where the underlying land use authorization is invalid.”DEQ spokesperson Lauren Wirtis said the agency will consult with the Department of Justice on the questions the organization is raising. Jennifer Kalez, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, said the agency is reviewing Columbia Riverkeeper’s position and expects to respond within the next week. “We will do our due diligence to evaluate how LUBA’s decision may affect the energy facility” she said.Columbia Riverkeeper said it is also looking at other legal avenues to dispute the validity of the air permit.Backers of the project are hoping to open the facility in 2024 and say it would create 3,500 temporary construction jobs, 240 permanent jobs during operation and generate more than $45 million in state and local tax revenue annually.Renewable diesel is a replacement for petroleum-based diesel that is refined from vegetable oil, animal fats, seed oil and waste grease. Backers of the project say the life-cycle greenhouse emissions are 80% lower than petroleum-based fuels. Meanwhile, transportation emissions account for the largest portion of Oregon’s emissions and have been the most difficult sector to achieve reductions in.Community members and conservation groups claim the project would pose a major pollution risk for the Port Westward community as well as those downwind and downstream from the refinery and railyard. They say DEQ’s analysis downplayed those risks.The facility expects to produce 1.6 million gallons a day of fuel at startup and 2.1 million gallons a day at full capacity. It would consume large amounts of natural gas in the process, with associated emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.- Ted Sickinger; tsickinger@oregonian.com; 503-221-8505; @tedsickingerIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",152,"'-221':746 '-8505':747 '1.6':704 '124sharesby':16 '2':32 '2.1':714 '2024':569 '240':580 '3':575 '45':589 '500':576 '503':745 '80':632 'account':642,757 'achiev':659 'activ':398 'ad':287 'advanc':322 'affect':343,535 'agenc':354,481,507 'agricultur':135 'air':150,241,345,390,460,557 'allow':133 'also':545 'amount':726 'analysi':696 'anim':613 'annually.renewable':597 'anoth':235,414 'appeal':110 'appeals.columbia':84 'approv':62,89,162,189,225,282,431 'argu':60,142 'ask':23 'associ':734 'august':164 'author':29,472 'avenu':550 'awar':351 'backer':97,207,620 'base':100,210,605,637 'believ':196,358 'billion':34 'billion-plus':33 'board':82,117,327 'bottom':439 'call':68 'capac':721 'certif':420 'claim':291,666 'clatskanie.columbia':45 'clatskanie.new':15 'columbia':42,57,194,214,288,510 'commiss':320 'commission':86 'communiti':679 'compani':412,456 'compens':769 'conform':272 'conserv':104,363,664 'consist':424 'construct':578 'consult':483 'consum':724 'controversi':51 'counti':85,192,228,285 'creat':574 'cycl':628 'day':708,718 'decis':74,112,147,340,533 'decision.next':263 'deliveri':382 'depart':158,177,486,502 'deq':308,421,475,694 'diesel':7,37,53,598,606 'difficult':656 'dilig':527 'director':310,364 'disingenu':294 'disput':552 'downplay':697 'downstream':686 'downwind':684 'due':526 'either':293 'email':454 'email.he':302 'emiss':403,630,641,650,735 'energi':179,504,537 'environment':160,318 'estuari':59 'evalu':529 'exempt':169 'expect':515,701 'facil':130,155,239,371,538,567,700 'fat':614 'februari':88 'feedstock':384 'feldman':312 'follow':71 'fuel':638,710 'full':720 'gallon':706,716 'gas':729 'gase':738 'generat':586 'grant':168 'greas':619 'greenhous':629,737 'group':105,367,665 'hinrich':201,298 'hope':563 'houston':99,209 'houston-bas':98,208 'impact':258 'in.community':661 'industri':12 'inform':409 'integr':374 'interim':309 'invalid':474 'jennif':496 'job':579,582 'justic':488 'kalez':497 'key':73 'land':80,90,116,136,145,187,223,261,274,338,426,470 'larg':725 'largest':645 'late':121 'lauren':477 'law':276 'leah':311 'legal':549 'life':627 'life-cycl':626 'line':440 'link':245,762 'list':394 'local':108,594 'look':546 'lower':633 'luba':531 'major':415,672 'may':534,767 'meanwhil':639 'meet':330 'member':315,662 'memo':306 'mid':333 'mid-novemb':332 'million':590,705,715 'moreov':404 'natur':728 'near':44 'new':281 'next':101,211,218,520 'novemb':334 'obtain':171,220 'octob':76,122 'oil':612,616 'one':229,759 'open':565 'oper':445,584 'oppos':48 'oregon':24,648 'oregonian/oregonliveconservationists':20 'organ':493 'outsid':14 'park':13 'part':375 'perman':581 'permit':92,152,174,243,391,416,463 'permit.backers':558 'permit.columbia':346 'petroleum':604,636 'petroleum-bas':603,635 'planned.columbia':138 'plus':35 'point':303 'polici':325 'pollut':673,741 'port':10,677 'portion':646 'pose':670 'posit':356,513 'predic':184 'previous':167 'process':732 'produc':703 'product':752 'project':65,95,206,378,561,623,668 'propos':5,39,125,396 'purchas':750 'qualiti':151,161,242,319,419 'question':70,491 'rail':126,232,251,268,370,397,435,448 'railyard':691 'rais':495 'reappli':278 'receiv':459,768 'redesign':266 'reduct':660 'refin':238,609 'refineri':8,38,54,248,387,438,442,689 'regist':754 'regul':25,428 'regular':329 'render':2 'renew':6,36,52,102,212,219,264 'replac':601 'request':407 'requir':379,430 'resid':109 'respond':517 'revenu':596 'review':509 'revok':27 'revoked.michael':200 'risk':674 'risks.the':699 'river':43,58 'riverkeep':46,139,195,215,289,347,511,541 'rule':119 'said':213,254,299,336,348,368,393,422,451,479,505,542 'said.columbia':540 'say':571,624,693 'sector':657 'seed':615 'sent':313 'separ':222 'serr':362,450 'set':326 'sicking':18,743 'simpli':296 'site':49,173,765 'situat':466 'sourc':401 'spokesperson':203,476,499 'startup':712 'state':28,79,115,592 'suppli':388 'tax':595 'ted':17,742 'tedsickingerif':748 'temporari':577 'transport':640 'tsickinger@oregonian.com':744 'two':221 'under':469 'undercut':148 'uninform':297 'use':81,91,146,188,224,262,275,339,427,471 'valid':554 'veget':611 'wast':618 'water':418,462 'week':22,521 'well':681 'westward':11,678 'wirti':478 'within':518 'without':446 'would':429,573,669,723 'wrong':217 'wrong.dan':361 'yard':127,233,252,269,436,449",
"Intel, cutting costs, offers unpaid leave to factory workers worldwide",Mike Rogoway,Oregon Tech,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 1:48 p.m.",0,"Workers in white bunnysuits and glasses move through an Intel clean room in Hillsboro. NEW!By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIntel is offering thousands of manufacturing employees three months of unpaid leave, another effort to trim its budget amid a historic sales decline.“Retaining our manufacturing talent is a key element of positioning Intel for long-term growth,” Intel said in a written statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive. “Voluntary time off programs allow us an opportunity to reduce short term costs and offer employees attractive time off options.”The Financial Times reported Friday that the program was available to factory workers in Ireland. Intel said the same program is available at its facilities worldwide, including in the U.S. The company declined to say whether employees retain benefits while on leave.Intel is Oregon’s largest corporate employer, with 22,000 people assigned to its manufacturing, research and administrative campuses in Washington County. The company also has factories in Arizona, New Mexico, Ireland and Israel, with additional assembly and test sites in China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Costa Rica.Intel told employees in October to expect layoffs and leaner budgets as it sought $3 billion in savings next year, and billions more in coming years.The chipmaker’s third-quarter sales were down 20% from a year earlier amid a precipitous decline in the PC market and reduced demand from data centers. The slowdown comes at a particularly inopportune time, as Intel has committed to spend $80 billion to beef up engineering and build new factories in Arizona, Ohio and Germany.There’s growing optimism within the industry that the chip market could begin recovering next year, though, and there’s broad agreement that long-term demand for semiconductors will be robust.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has built his turnaround plan on revitalizing the company’s manufacturing prowess, so the unpaid leave may represent Intel’s effort to manage the current downturn without doing permanent damage to its factory network.-- Mike Rogoway | mrogoway@oregonian.com | 503-294-7699 | Twitter: @rogoway |Our journalism needs your support.

Dear Annie: Wife who moved on from husband’s infidelity shares some tips,Annie Lane,Advice,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 4:00 p.m.",0,"Annie Lane writes the Dear Annie advice column.NEW!By Annie LaneDear Readers: A number of you wrote to me in response to “Still Recovering,” the woman who was not yet over her husband’s affair from seven years earlier. You offered a range of different perspectives gained from personal experiences with infidelity. Below are two good examples that may be of use to “Still Recovering” and to any reader who is struggling with infidelity in a relationship. For a more in-depth dive into the subject, you can also order “How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” -- the book I released last year -- on Amazon.Dear Annie: Our family went through some tough times a few years back, which ultimately led to my husband being unfaithful. When I found out, I packed his things and told him I never wanted to see him again. I even served him divorce papers in front of his new girlfriend. We were separated for six months before we realized that we were really good together, and we both were at fault for why we drifted apart in the first place. I was not loving and attentive due to issues involving the children, and I put my husband’s needs last.I decided to forgive him only after I saw him take responsibility for his infidelity, show true remorse for the actions that completely destroyed me, make an attempt to repair our relationship and make a continued effort to never repeat his mistake.It is not always easy. I think about that part of our life from time to time. But the day I decided to continue working on our marriage was the day I was no longer allowed to hold that time against him. You accept your partner for all their faults and shouldn’t hold their feet to the fire if they’re making conscious efforts to move past their ugliest behaviors. Hold them accountable in the moment but remember it’s just a moment. -- Happier With Him AroundDear Annie: I would like to respond to “Still Recovering,” whose husband had an affair that left her traumatized. Regular talk therapy can certainly be helpful, but I would suggest she look into a therapist trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR. This therapy is designed specifically for trauma and the tendency to ruminate over those traumatic events. I have two friends who have experienced EMDR, one for infidelity and another for the loss of a spouse, and both experienced dramatic relief within six to eight sessions. While the memories are still present, they no longer hold the emotional pain they once did. There are many books from established scientists on the subject, and you can also learn more and find a therapist at the website www.emdria.org.Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.COPYRIGHT 2022 CREATORS.COMIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",71,"'2022':470 'accept':290 'account':320,480 'action':226 'advic':7 'affair':35,348 'allow':282 'also':90,452 'alway':250 'amazon.dear':106 'anni':1,6,10,107,335,466 'anoth':406 'apart':182 'arounddear':334 'attempt':233 'attent':192 'back':118 'behavior':317 'book':100,442 'certain':357 'cheat':97 'children':198 'column.new':8 'compens':492 'complet':228 'conscious':310 'continu':241,270 'creators.comif':471 'day':266,277 'dear':5 'dearannie@creators.com.copyright':469 'decid':207,268 'depth':83 'desensit':373 'design':381 'destroy':229 'differ':45 'dive':84 'divorc':149 'dramat':416 'drift':181 'due':193 'earlier':39 'easi':251 'effort':242,311 'eight':421 'emdr':377,401 'emot':434 'establish':444 'even':146 'event':393 'exampl':57 'experi':50 'experienc':400,415 'eye':371 'famili':109 'fault':177,296 'feet':302 'find':456 'fire':305 'first':185 'forgiv':95,209 'found':129 'friend':397 'front':152 'gain':47 'girlfriend':156 'good':56,170 'happier':331 'help':359 'hold':284,300,318,432 'husband':33,124,203,345 'in-depth':81 'infidel':52,74,220,404 'involv':196 'issu':195 'lane':2,467 'lanedear':11 'last':103 'last.i':206 'learn':453 'led':121 'left':350 'life':259 'like':338 'link':485 'longer':281,431 'look':365 'loss':409 'love':190 'make':231,239,309 'mani':441 'marriag':274 'may':59,490 'memori':425 'mistake.it':247 'moment':323,330 'month':162 'move':313 'movement':372 'need':205 'never':139,244 'new':155 'number':14 'offer':41 'one':402,482 'order':91 'pack':132 'pain':435 'paper':150 'part':256 'partner':98,292 'past':314 'person':49 'perspect':46 'place':186 'present':428 'product':475 'purchas':473 'put':201 'question':464 'rang':43 're':308 'reader':12,69 'realiz':165 'realli':169 'receiv':491 'recov':24,65,343 'regist':477 'regular':353 'relationship':77,237 'releas':102 'relief':417 'rememb':325 'remors':223 'repair':235 'repeat':245 'reprocess':375 'respond':340 'respons':21,217 'rumin':389 'saw':214 'scientist':445 'see':142 'separ':159 'serv':147 'session':422 'seven':37 'shouldn':298 'show':221 'site':488 'six':161,419 'specif':382 'spous':412 'still':23,64,342,427 'struggl':72 'subject':87,448 'suggest':363 'take':216 'talk':354 'tendenc':387 'therapi':355,379 'therapist':368,458 'thing':134 'think':253 'time':114,261,263,286 'togeth':171 'told':136 'tough':113 'train':369 'trauma':384 'traumat':352,392 'true':222 'two':55,396 'ugliest':316 'ultim':120 'unfaith':126 'use':62 'want':140 'websit':461 'went':110 'whose':344 'within':418 'woman':26 'work':271 'would':337,362 'write':3 'wrote':17 'www.emdria.org.send':462 'year':38,104,117 'yet':30",

The women were roommates, and Chapin was dating Kernodle.Authorities have said they were each stabbed multiple times, and that some had defensive wounds.On Sunday, law enforcement officers investigating the deaths asked for patience after a week passed with no arrests.Police have said evidence leads them to believe the students were targeted, but have repeatedly declined to give details.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",188,"'000':181 '1':248 '13':172 '17':44 '20':255,270 '2022':45 '21':262,277 '25':180 'abl':123,144 'account':347 'alen':266 'along':5 'also':199 'ap':83 'apnew':84 'arrests.police':320 'ask':194,311 'associ':87 'attack':222 'autopsi':49 'bed':101 'believ':224,327 'blade':230 'bois':1,39,47 'campus':41,64 'chapin':254,286 'coeur':264 'compens':359 'confer':239 'contact':196 'convers':207 'coron':76 'could':186 'counti':75 'd':265 'date':288 'day':23 'dead':58 'death':72,92,310 'declin':335 'defens':302 'depart':151 'describ':211 'details.if':338 'detect':105,188 'earlier':24 'enforc':306 'ethan':253 'evid':323 'extens':108 'fall':273 'fix':229 'fix-blad':228 'found':18,57 'four':11,53,68,94 'front':33 'give':337 'goncalv':136,276 'haven':141 'held':31 'help':187 'hold':236 'hous':62 'hundr':129 'idaho':14,22,48,97,176,267,274,280 'identifi':146 'inform':110,133,184 'insid':59 'investig':89,246,308 'it.investigators':126 'kayle':135 'kernodl':269 'kernodle.authorities':289 'kill':19,173 'knew':9 'knife.police':231 'latah':74 'law':305 'lead':324 'link':352 'look':107 'madison':260 'may':357 'miller/idaho':80 'mogen':261 'monday':233 'moscow':21,149,197 'mount':257 'much':206 'multipl':296 'near':63 'news':155,238 'nov':43,171 'offic':307 'one':112,147,349 'p.m':249 'panhandl':177 'pass':317 'patienc':313 'pay':25 'peopl':7 'perform':50 'piec':131 'polic':150 'police.police':198 'post':272 'pressauthor':88 'product':342 'public':243 'purchas':340 'pursu':128 'rathdrum':279 'receiv':358 'regist':344 'release.authorities':156 'rental':61 'repeat':334 'residents.anyone':182 'respect':27 'roommat':284 'said':77,102,152,158,200,232,291,322 'sarah':78 'shook':174 'show':65 'site':355 'stab':70,91,295 'stalker':118,139,191 'state':2,40 'statesman':81 'statu':36 'student':4,15,54,98,329 'sunday':304 'suspect':162 'target':331 'thursday':42 'time':297 'tip':192 'town':178 'tuesday':103,201 'type':218 'univers':3,12,95 'updat':241 'use':214,219 'verifi':125 'vernon':258 'via':82 'victim':115,251 'vigil':30 'washington':259 'weapon':164,213 'wednesday.the':250 'week':168,316 'women':282 'would':235 'wounds.on':303 'xana':268",
Readers respond: Oregon’s Measure 114 worth the cost,Letters to the editor,Opinion,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Letters to the editor | The OregonianI’m so sick of all the whining and complaining about the complexities of Measure 114 passing. Yes, it’s complicated. No, it’s not perfect. But we have a national crisis on our hands involving disturbed young men and high-capacity guns.If the people who need to buy and use guns are inconvenienced for a while, too bad. It’s beyond my comprehension that people don’t realize the cost of not doing anything is greater than a few people having to wait longer or pay more for their guns.With preventative measures, we can’t always connect the dots between an action and a non-event.

"Dear Doctor: Can high doses of vitamin C, D, or zinc prevent COVID-19?",Dr. Keith Roach,Health,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: Am I taking too many vitamins, and are there benefits in taking all these vitamins? I started taking fish oil for my heart; 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 was suggested by my gastroenterologist; a multi-vitamin because my mom has macular degeneration; and I started taking zinc and vitamin C because I heard it will help with COVID symptoms. -- K.P.A.ANSWER: Vitamins in reasonable doses are seldom dangerous, although some can be at very high doses. Let’s take a look at each of your questions.Fish oil has been shown to modestly improve blood pressure and cholesterol, and a prescription version reduced heart attack risk in people with high triglyceride levels in one study. In another study in people taking statins, fish oil had no additional benefit.Vitamin D has been very controversial. Recent studies have found that vitamin D did not “prevent cancer or cardiovascular disease, prevent falls, improve cognitive function, reduce atrial fibrillation, reduce migraine frequency, decrease age-related macular degeneration or reduce knee pain.” Of course, there are some people who still benefit from vitamin D, such as people with osteoporosis, who cannot absorb vitamin D well, or who live where they never get sun exposure. The 2,000 IU you are taking is safe.People with the dry form of macular degeneration benefit from a particular multivitamin (called the AREDS or AREDS 2 formulation) to slow progression of this condition that affects central vision. However, studies designed to show prevention of macular degeneration with the same formulation could not show a benefit. Again, though, there is no harm from these supplements, except that smokers should not take the original AREDS formulation, since they had a higher risk of lung cancer.Multiple studies have looked to see whether vitamin C, zinc or vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 or reduce its severity; unfortunately, the preponderance of the evidence shows no convincing benefit. Taking supplements is no substitute for vaccination and prudent behavior. Scientists have not proven that vitamin and mineral supplements benefit you for the conditions you are concerned about, but it is still possible that there is a benefit that is too small to find within the types of studies already done. The downside of these particular supplements at reasonable doses is small.DEAR DR. ROACH: A doctor friend suggested I purchase a nitric oxide nasal spray from Israel. She suggested using it when eating out or hanging out with friends maskless. Do you have an opinion about its efficacy? I got the most recent booster and a flu shot. The reason I’m concerned is that I see an uptick in people around me getting COVID for either the first or second time. And I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren. -- P.L.ANSWER: There are some reasons to be optimistic about this treatment. Two studies have shown improvement in people with COVID-19 using the nasal spray, but there are no published data I can find to show that the spray prevents infection in the first place. I did find an ongoing study in people with asymptomatic COVID-19, but the results are not yet available.

‘Mixed emotions’: Portland preschool faces closure as church repurposes land to house Indigenous families,Rose Wong,Education,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",212,"Teacher Annette said a large space allows children to explore and become independent learners. ""We've grown to realize having a large outdoor space is pretty magical for kids,"" she said.NEW!212sharesBy Rose Wong | The Oregonian/OregonLiveAfter 25 years of operating in the Presbyterian Church of Laurelhurst, Portland Tillamook Preschool must find a new location by next summer or face closure.Presbytery of the Cascades, a governing body of more than 90 congregations including the Presbyterian Church of Laurelhurst, informed the preschool in October that it will terminate its lease a year earlier than scheduled. The school will need to vacate the Northeast Portland church building by the end of June.“We regret that we could not continue to maintain the lease for the full five years … but we are now making new commitments to the site and needed to make use of our ‘termination at will’ option in the lease agreement,” said Brian Heron, executive presbyter of the Presbytery of the Cascades.The Presbytery intends to repurpose the land where the church stands into a tiny home village for Indigenous single parents and children. The collaboration with three other entities — Indigenous organization Future Generations Collaborative, affordable housing group Leaven Community Land and Housing Coalition and Westminster Presbytery Church. That may eventually result in the local Indigenous community assuming ownership of the land, as part of the national Land Back movement that advocates for returning land to Indigenous people, Heron said.The Presbytery is also looking for new uses for three of its other properties where congregations have closed, including nine acres in Beaverton that will become affordable housing.“I have such mixed emotions,” said Anna Lagasse, board president of Tillamook Preschool. “I’m feeling responsible for finding this school a new location, but also I think what the church is doing is wonderful.”Lagasse’s 5-year-old son, Grayson, attends the cooperative preschool, a not-for-profit organization run by parents who sign up for responsibilities at the start of the academic year. Parents may be in charge of building maintenance, laundry or administrative work. The school has 38 children split between two classes that meet on alternate days of the week. Classes are run by a teacher, the school’s only paid employee, with the help of at least three parents.While the lease ends in June, registration for the next school year begins in January. The school typically hosts an open house for prospective students and families after the New Year.“It’s hard to draw new families in without a location,” Lagasse said.Preschool allows children to develop social-emotional skills and adjust to environments outside of the home when their brains are most elastic, ensuring that they arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. Extensive research has shown children who attend high-quality preschools experience better social, health and economic outcomes later in life.Working families also rely on preschools for childcare. A 2021 Oregon State University study showed that more than half of Multnomah County’s preschool-aged children did not have access to childcare slots before the pandemic. Every county in the state was designated as a childcare desert for children between ages 0 and 2, meaning 70% of children did not have access to childcare slots, the report found.During the pandemic, Multnomah County lost 300, or a fifth, of its childcare providers, according to the county, putting added strain on families looking for quality childcare options.In its current location, Tillamook Preschool has access to a building with ample natural light, an indoor gym and a large outdoor space with a playground — ideal for a play-based school that encourages creativity and independence through the use of open space, Lagasse said.The church has also offered affordable rent that’s inaccessible in most of Portland, she added. Finding a new, affordable home will be a challenge. Lagasse said they need a minimum of 1,300 square feet of ground-floor classroom space with adequate windows and direct access to an outdoor playground. She said they are asking members of the community to reach out with any leads.Annette Horten has worked for Tillamook Preschool and been known by children and parents as Teacher Annette for 20 years. She said parents whose children have finished preschool years ago still keep in touch.Whatever happens to Tillamook, Horten said she will remain an educator. But she said she’s not thinking about her Plan B right now. She is more concerned about what it would mean for the curious, free-roaming preschoolers that rely on the school if it isn’t able to find a new space that fits their needs.“I’ve always considered this space like a second teacher,” she said.-- Rose Wong covers early childhood education for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Hubert (11) and Cole Bishop (8) during the first half of the Pac-12 Conference championship NCAA college football game Friday, Dec. 2, 2022, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Steve Marcus)APNEW!505sharesBy Mark Anderson | AP Sports WriterCaleb Williams once again was starring in his own highlight video, breaking four tackles and finding himself in the open field for a 59-yard gain.No. 4 USC looked as if it would do whatever it wanted against No. 11 Utah and coast into the College Football Playoff. But, Williams pulled his hamstring on that play and was never the same.Neither were the Trojans, whose hope for a spot in the College Football Playoff all but ended as Utah rolled to a 47-24 win in the Pac-12 championship game Friday night in Las Vegas.“Our play didn’t really resemble the way we played the majority of this year,” first-year USC coach Lincoln Riley said. “Disappointed with some of the missed opportunities out there, but that’s the name of the game when you get to this level in these kind of games against good football teams. You’ve got to go play good football to win, and we didn’t do it.”The loss by the Trojans (11-2) could open the way for No. 5 Ohio State (11-1) to take their spot in the playoff.Ohio State coach Ryan Day had to be Utah’s biggest fan. If the Buckeyes do move up into playoff position, with 12-0 Michigan at No. 2 with the Big Ten championship game on Saturday, it would give that conference two playoff teams for the first time. It also would extend the Pac-12's playoff drought — Washington in 2017 is the last team from that conference to make the playoff.“Coach Day, you’re welcome,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham directed at Ohio State coach Ryan Day on the Fox Sports broadcast after the win.Utah (10-3) is heading to the Rose Bowl, but the Utes already were going there regardless of the outcome of the title game. They are responsible for USC’s only losses, having edged the Trojans 43-42 on Oct. 15 in Salt Lake City.The Utes rolled up 533 yards of offense in the rematch, and Cam Rising passed for 310 yards and three touchdowns to earn game MVP honors.Williams threw for 363 yards and three TDs. He entered the game as the leading Heisman Trophy candidate, but wasn’t the same after getting injured in the first quarter.Backup Miller Moss even took snaps on the sideline in the second half.“I asked (Williams) at one point, ‘Are you 50%?’” Riley said. “He was not even close to 50%. I definitely thought about taking him out. He didn’t let me. He wouldn’t even let me take him out at the end. In terms of guys I’ve coached at that position, it may be the gutsiest performance I’ve ever seen. Most guys wouldn’t even have played, and he still gave us a chance.”Williams, who also played with a badly cut pinky on his throwing hand, said his hamstring felt like “an old rubber band.”“I was in my head and encouraging (myself) the game was bigger than I was feeling,” Williams said, drawing inspiration from a Kobe Bryant quote. “I also had a group of guys looking at me to go out there and lead them to victory.”Williams painted his fingernails before game that read “(Expletive) Utah,” though the Utes apparently weren’t aware of that until told afterward.“You can put whatever you want on your nails,” Utah running back Ja’Quinden Jackson said. “I’m not going to judge him ... but I hope he liked it.”The Trojans looked as if they were going to run away with the game, taking a 17-3 lead early in the second quarter behind some stellar play by Williams. He passed for 108 yards and two TDs and rushed for 76 yards in the first quarterAfter USC failed to pick up a fourth and 8 from Utah’s 37-yard line, the Utes scored two touchdowns in the final 3:55 of the first half, and suddenly the score was tied at 17-17. Instead of a rout, the game was beginning to look like the shootout the Utes won in October.The game took on that tone at times in the second half, but USC had no answer for how to slow down Utah, which outscored the Trojans 44-7 in overcoming that two-touchdown deficit.“Just unwavering belief,” Rising said.ATTENDANCE RECORDA announced sellout crowd of 61,195 made this the largest for a neutral-site Pac-12 championship. It beat the previous record of 58,476 fans who watched USC-Stanford in Santa Clara, California, in 2015.-- The Associated PressIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",165,"'-0':262 '-1':232 '-12':25,136,293,798 '-17':722 '-2':221 '-24':131 '-3':336,655 '-42':371 '-7':768 '10':335 '108':671 '11':13,87,220,231 '12':261 '13':5 '15':374 '17':654,721 '195':787 '2':34,266 '2015':819 '2017':299 '2022':35 '3':708 '310':394 '363':406 '37':697 '4':74 '43':370 '44':767 '47':130 '476':807 '5':228 '50':453,462 '505sharesby':43 '533':382 '55':709 '58':806 '59':71 '61':786 '76':679 '8':17,693 'account':831 'afterward':608 'alreadi':346 'also':288,523,569 'anderson':45 'announc':782 'answer':756 'ap':39,46 'apnew':42 'appar':600 'ask':446 'associ':821 'awar':603 'away':648 'back':620 'bad':527 'band':542 'beat':801 'begin':730 'behind':662 'belief':778 'big':269 'bigger':554 'biggest':249 'bishop':16 'bowl':342 'break':59 'broadcast':331 'bryant':566 'buckey':253 'caleb':3 'california':817 'cam':390 'candid':420 'championship':27,137,271,799 'chanc':520 'city.the':378 'clara':816 'close':460 'coach':163,241,311,317,324,493 'coast':90 'cole':15 'colleg':29,93,119 'compens':843 'confer':26,279,306 'could':222 'crowd':784 'cut':528 'day':243,312,326 'dec':33 'deficit':775 'definit':464 'didn':146,211,471 'direct':320 'disappoint':167 'draw':561 'drought':296 'earli':657 'earn':400 'edg':367 'encourag':549 'end':124,486 'enter':412 'even':435,459,478,511 'ever':505 'explet':595 'extend':290 'fail':686 'fan':250,808 'feel':558 'felt':537 'field':68 'final':707 'find':63 'fingernail':590 'first':20,160,285,431,683,712 'first-year':159 'footbal':30,94,120,197,206 'four':60 'fourth':691 'fox':329 'friday':32,139 'gain.no':73 'game':31,138,183,194,272,357,401,414,552,592,651,728,741 'gave':517 'get':186,427 'give':277 'go':203,348,579,628,645 'good':196,205 'got':201 'group':572 'gutsiest':501 'guy':490,508,574 'half':21,444,713,751 'hamstr':100,536 'hand':533 'head':338,547 'heisman':418 'highlight':57 'honors.williams':403 'hope':113,634 'hubert':12 'injur':428 'inspir':562 'instead':723 'ja':621 'jackson':623 'judg':630 'kind':192 'kobe':565 'kyle':318 'lake':377 'largest':791 'las':37,142 'last':302 'lead':417,583,656 'let':473,479 'level':189 'like':538,636,733 'lincoln':164 'line':699 'link':836 'look':76,575,640,732 'loss':216,365 'm':626 'made':788 'major':155 'make':308 'marcus':41 'mark':44 'may':498,841 'michigan':263 'miller':433 'miss':172 'moss':434 'move':255 'mvp':402 'nail':617 'name':180 'ncaa':28 'neutral':795 'neutral-sit':794 'never':106 'night':140 'oct':373 'october.the':740 'offens':385 'ohio':229,322 'old':540 'one':449,833 'open':67,223 'opportun':173 'outcom':353 'outscor':764 'overcom':770 'pac':24,135,292,797 'paint':588 'pass':392,669 'perform':502 'photo/steve':40 'pick':688 'pinki':529 'play':103,145,153,204,513,524,665 'playoff':95,121,258,281,295,310 'playoff.ohio':239 'point':450 'posit':259,496 'pressif':822 'previous':803 'product':826 'pull':98 'purchas':824 'put':611 'quarter':661 'quarter.backup':432 'quarteraft':684 'quarterback':2 'quinden':622 'quot':567 'r.j':11 're':314 'read':594 'realli':148 'receiv':842 'record':804 'recorda':781 'regardless':350 'regist':828 'rematch':388 'resembl':149 'respons':360 'riley':165,454 'rise':391,779 'roll':127,380 'rose':341 'rout':726 'rubber':541 'run':619,647 'rush':677 'ryan':242,325 'safeti':10 'said':166,455,534,560,624 'said.attendance':780 'salt':376 'same.neither':108 'santa':815 'saturday':274 'score':702,717 'second':443,660,750 'seen':506 'sellout':783 'shootout':735 'sidelin':440 'site':796,839 'slow':760 'snap':437 'sport':47,330 'spot':116,236 'stanford':813 'star':53 'state':230,240,323 'stellar':664 'still':516 'sudden':715 'tackl':7,61 'take':234,467,481,652 'tds':410,675 'team':198,282,303 'ten':270 'term':488 'though':597 'thought':465 'three':397,409 'threw':404 'throw':532 'tie':719 'time':286,747 'titl':356 'told':607 'tone':745 'took':436,742 'touchdown':398,704,774 'trojan':111,219,369,639,766 'trophi':419 'two':280,674,703,773 'two-touchdown':772 'unwav':777 'us':518 'usc':1,75,162,362,685,753,812 'usc-stanford':811 'utah':9,88,126,247,316,596,618,695,762 'ute':345,379,599,701,737 've':200,492,504 'vega':38,143 'victori':586 'video':58 'want':84,614 'washington':297 'wasn':422 'watch':810 'way':151,225 'welcom':315 'weren':601 'whatev':82,612 'whittingham':319 'whose':112 'william':4,49,97,447,521,559,587,667 'win':132,208 'win.utah':334 'won':738 'would':80,276,289 'wouldn':476,509 'writercaleb':48 'yard':72,383,395,407,672,680,698 'year':158,161","{""AP Sports Writer""}"
"Oregon lost students but added teachers, state report shows",Julia Silverman,Education,,"Nov. 18, 2022, 7:17 a.m.",0,"Teachers and students in the hallway at Portland's Duniway Elementary School. Statewide, Oregon added teachers in the 2021-2022 school year, even as public school enrollment declined.Portland Public Schools/FlickrNEW!By Julia Silverman | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe total number of teachers employed in Oregon’s public schools in the 2021-2022 school year hit an all-time high, even as the number of enrolled students dropped precipitously, to its lowest level in nearly two decades.That’s according to the Oregon Department of Education’s annual statewide “report card,” released Thursday, which offers a broad overview of education data and trends.Overall, there were 32,836 teachers in Oregon public school classrooms in the ‘21-22 school year, or 1,508 more educators than in the 2017-2018 academic year, according to counts of full-time equivalent positions. That was the case even though there were 27,672 fewer students enrolled statewide last school year than five years ago.In Oregon, state education funding follows students; if enrollment trends don’t recover, the state’s 197 school districts could find themselves having to lay off staff in the not-too-distant future. Teacher cutbacks would be most likely in the districts where enrollment has fallen most steeply.For now, metro-area school districts have used an infusion of federal and state money, along with local rainy-day funds, to avoid making such cuts, particularly given that many students are struggling academically and mentally after two years of COVID-19-related disruptions.The decline in enrollment has been linked to the pandemic, which saw some students opt for private and online alternatives, while others dropped out, vanished from the system or joined the workforce. But it has also been exacerbated by a declining birthrate, demographers at Portland State University have said, along with rising housing costs, which have led some families to move or put off having children.“The student enrollment issue that we are seeing now is not one we believe will continue,” said Reed Scott-Schwalbach, president of the Oregon Education Association and a high school Spanish teacher at Centennial High School in eastern Multnomah County. “They are coming back at different levels. The high school enrollment went up in the past year. We need to make sure we have the professionals and robust services so that when they come back into the public school system, they can have their needs met.”At Portland Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, district administrators floated a proposal last winter to cut more than 100 educator positions, citing declining enrollment. They faced a wall of pushback from parents and teachers alike, and eventually preserved nearly all of those jobs, in part by tapping into reserves. Still, some school board members warned that they’d have to pay the piper down the line, especially if enrollment doesn’t rebound.“We are getting a lot of emails about, ‘Preserve all these positions, preserve all these class sizes,” PPS school board member Andrew Scott said at a March 9 meeting. “I have a feeling that is going to result in a huge cliff in one to two years.”!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();
One position that saw particular growth in the 2021-2022 school year: School counselors, whose ranks swelled 8.8 percent statewide, as schools tried to cope with escalating mental health issues and behavioral problems among their students. Some of those personnel were hired with money from the federal government’s Elementary and Secondary School Education Recovery act, which is earmarked for pandemic relief, and is use-it-or-lose-it by September 2024.Even as educator ranks have grown, schools in Oregon and nationally have been struggling to fill other key roles, including custodians, school bus drivers, mental health professionals and, substitutes. Beaverton schools, for example, currently have open job postings for only half a dozen classroom educators, but they are actively looking for at least 22 paraeducators, who provide individual support to students with special needs.“The problem is we are still competing for the same pool of applicants,” said Sharon Reese, chief of human resources for Portland Public Schools. “Where are we struggling? It’s special education. It’s counselors and other mental health professionals. Even though we are seeing a decreasing number of students, we are seeing an increase in the needs of our students.”--Julia Silverman, jsilverman@oregonian.com, @jrlsilvermanIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",84,"'-19':248 '-2018':125 '-2022':20,49,581 '-22':113 '0':534,554 '1':117 '100':424 '197':173 '2017':124 '2021':19,48,580 '2024.even':644 '21':112 '22':697 '27':145 '32':102 '508':118 '672':146 '8.8':589 '836':103 '9':505 'academ':126,240 'accord':76,128 'account':781 'act':627 'activ':692 'ad':15 'administr':414 'ago.in':157 'alik':440 'all-tim':54 'along':221,299 'also':285 'altern':269 'among':605 'andrew':499 'annual':84 'applic':720 'area':209 'associ':342 'avoid':229 'back':360,391 'beaverton':673 'behavior':603 'believ':329 'birthrat':291 'board':458,497 'broad':93 'bus':666 'card':87 'case':140 'centenni':350 'chief':724 'children':315 'cite':427 'class':493 'classroom':109,687 'cliff':519 'come':359,390 'compens':793 'compet':714 'contentwindow':561 'continu':331 'cope':596 'cost':303 'could':176 'counselor':585,742 'count':130 'counti':356 'covid':247 'current':677 'custodian':664 'cut':232,421 'cutback':192 'd':463 'data':97 'datawrapp':537,549,568 'datawrapper-height':536,548,567 'day':226 'decades.that':74 'declin':251,290,428 'declined.portland':28 'decreas':754 'demograph':292 'depart':80 'differ':362 'disruptions.the':250 'distant':189 'district':175,199,211,412,413 'document.queryselectorall':541 'doesn':475 'dozen':686 'driver':667 'drop':65,272 'duniway':10 'e':531 'e.data':535,547,566 'e.source':562 'earmark':630 'eastern':354 'educ':82,96,120,160,341,425,625,646,688,739 'elementari':11,621 'email':484 'employ':40 'enrol':27,63,149,165,201,253,318,367,429,474 'equival':135 'escal':598 'especi':472 'even':23,58,141,748 'eventu':442 'exacerb':287 'exampl':676 'face':431 'fallen':203 'famili':308 'feder':217,618 'feel':510 'fewer':147 'fill':659 'find':177 'five':155 'float':415 'follow':162 'full':133 'full-tim':132 'function':525,530 'fund':161,227 'futur':190 'get':480 'given':234 'go':513 'govern':619 'grown':649 'growth':577 'half':684 'hallway':6 'health':600,669,746 'height':538,550,569 'high':57,345,351,365 'hire':613 'hit':52 'hous':302 'huge':518 'human':726 'ifram':542 'includ':663 'increas':762 'individu':701 'infus':215 'issu':319,601 'job':448,680 'join':279 'jrlsilvermanif':772 'jsilverman@oregonian.com':771 'julia':32,769 'key':661 'largest':410 'last':151,418 'lay':181 'least':696 'led':306 'level':70,363 'like':196 'line':471 'link':256,786 'local':223 'look':693 'lose':640 'lot':482 'lowest':69 'make':230,377 'mani':236 'march':504 'may':791 'meet':506 'member':459,498 'mental':242,599,668,745 'messag':529 'met':402 'metro':208 'metro-area':207 'money':220,615 'move':310 'multnomah':355 'nation':654 'near':72,444 'need':375,401,707,765 'not-too-dist':186 'number':37,61,755 'offer':91 'one':327,521,572,783 'onlin':268 'open':679 'opt':264 'oregon':14,42,79,106,158,340,652 'oregonian/oregonlivethe':35 'other':271 'overview':94 'pandem':259,632 'paraeduc':698 'parent':437 'part':450 'particular':233,576 'past':372 'pay':466 'percent':590 'personnel':611 'piper':468 'pool':718 'portland':8,294,404,729 'posit':136,426,489,573 'post':681 'pps':495 'precipit':66 'preserv':443,486,490 'presid':337 'privat':266 'problem':604,709 'product':776 'profession':382,670,747 'propos':417 'provid':700 'public':25,29,44,107,394,405,730 'purchas':774 'pushback':435 'put':312 'px':571 'r':553,555,557,560,564 'raini':225 'rainy-day':224 'rank':587,647 'rebound':477 'receiv':792 'recov':169 'recoveri':626 'reed':333 'rees':723 'regist':778 'relat':249 'releas':88 'relief':633 'report':86 'reserv':454 'resourc':727 'result':515 'rise':301 'robust':384 'role':662 'said':298,332,501,721 'saw':261,575 'school':12,21,26,45,50,108,114,152,174,210,346,352,366,395,406,411,457,496,582,584,593,624,650,665,674,731 'schools/flickrnew':30 'schwalbach':336 'scott':335,500 'scott-schwalbach':334 'secondari':623 'see':323,752,760 'septemb':643 'servic':385 'sharon':722 'silverman':33,770 'site':789 'size':494 'spanish':347 'special':706,738 'staff':183 'state':159,171,219,295,408 'statewid':13,85,150,591 'steeply.for':205 'still':455,713 'strict':527 'struggl':239,657,735 'student':3,64,148,163,237,263,317,607,704,757,768 'style.height':565 'substitut':672 'support':702 'sure':378 'swell':588 'system':277,396 't.length':556 'tap':452 'teacher':1,16,39,104,191,348,439 'though':142,749 'thursday':89 'time':56,134 'total':36 'trend':166 'trends.overall':99 'tri':594 'two':73,244,523 'univers':296 'use':213,526,637 'use-it-or-lose-it':636 'vanish':274 'var':539,544,552 'void':533 'wall':433 'warn':460 'went':368 'whose':586 'window.addeventlistener':528 'winter':419 'workforc':281 'would':193 'year':22,51,115,127,153,156,245,373,524,583","{""The Oregonian""}"
"U.S. House votes to impose contract on unions, head off railroad strike",The Associated Press,Business,"Nov. 30, 2022, 4:28 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 4:16 p.m.",0,"FILE - Freight train cars sit in a Norfolk Southern rail yard on Sept. 14, 2022, in Atlanta. Business groups are increasing the pressure on lawmakers to intervene and block a railroad strike before next month's deadline in the stalled contract talks. A coalition of more than 400 business groups sent a letter to Congressional leaders Monday, Nov. 28, 2022 urging them to step in because of fears about the devastating potential impact of a strike that could force many businesses to shut down. (AP Photo/Danny Karnik, File)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe U.S. House moved urgently to head off the looming nationwide rail strike on Wednesday, passing a bill that would bind companies and workers to a proposed settlement that was reached in September but rejected by some of the 12 unions involved.The measure passed by a vote of 290-137 and now heads to the Senate. If approved there, it will be signed by President Joe Biden, who urged the Senate to act swiftly.“Without the certainty of a final vote to avoid a shutdown this week, railroads will begin to halt the movement of critical materials like chemicals to clean our drinking water as soon as this weekend,” Biden said. “Let me say that again: without action this week, disruptions to our auto supply chains, our ability to move food to tables, and our ability to remove hazardous waste from gasoline refineries will begin.”Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation have warned that halting rail service would cause a devastating $2 billion per day hit to the economy.The bill would impose a compromise labor agreement brokered by the Biden administration that was ultimately voted down by four of the 12 unions representing roughly 115,000 employees at large freight railroads. The unions have threatened to strike if an agreement can’t be reached before a Dec. 9 deadline.Lawmakers from both parties expressed reservations about overriding the negotiations. The intervention was particularly difficult for Democratic lawmakers who have traditionally sought to align themselves with the politically powerful labor unions that criticized Biden’s move to intervene in the contract dispute and block a strike.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to that concern by adding a second vote Wednesday that would add seven days of paid sick leave per year for rail workers covered under the agreement. However, it will take effect only if the Senate goes along and passes both measures. The House passed the sick leave measure as well, but by a much narrower margin, 221-207, as Republicans overwhelmingly opposed it, indicating that prospects for passage of the add-on are slim in the evenly divided Senate.Business groups and the Association of American Railroads trade association praised the House vote to block the strike but urged senators to resist adding sick time to the deal.“Unless Congress wants to become the de facto endgame for future negotiations, any effort to put its thumb on the bargaining scale to artificially advantage either party, or otherwise obstruct a swift resolution, would be wholly irresponsible,” said Ian Jefferies, head of the AAR.On the other hand, the Transportation Trades Department labor coalition that includes all the rail unions praised the vote to add sick time and told lawmakers who voted against it they had “abandoned your working class constituents.”The focus now turns to the Senate where the timing for a vote is unclear. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will meet with Democratic senators Thursday to discuss the rail negotiations. Some Democrats are insistent that the Senate vote on providing seven days of paid sick leave.“A multibillion-dollar industry that is engaged in buybacks, that has doubled its profit margins during the pandemic should not be able to force its workers to come in when they are sick and injured,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.But most Republicans are reluctant to alter the tentative settlement reached in September.“I think it’s a bad precedent for us to get into the nuances and details of things like this that have been negotiated for three years,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.The call for paid sick leave was a major sticking point in the talks along with other quality-of-life concerns. The railroads say the unions have agreed in negotiations over the decades to forgo paid sick time in favor of higher wages and strong short-term disability benefits.Jefferies said Tuesday that railroads would consider adding paid sick time in the future, but said that change should wait for a new round of negotiations.The unions maintain that railroads can easily afford to add paid sick time at a time when they are recording record profits. Several of the big railroads involved in these contract talks reported more than $1 billion profit in the third quarter.“Quite frankly, the fact that paid leave is not part of the final agreement between railroads and labor is, in my opinion, obscene,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.Most rail workers don’t receive any paid sick time, but they do have short-term disability benefits that kick in after as little as four days and can replace some of their income for a year or more. Rail workers also receive vacation and personal leave days, but workers say it’s difficult to use those for illnesses because they must typically be approved far ahead of time.In the House, Republicans voiced support for the measure to block the strike, but criticized the Biden administration for turning to Congress to “step in to fix the mess.” Some 79 Republicans voted with the overwhelming majority of Democrats for the bill binding the parties to the tentative settlement.But Republicans criticized Pelosi’s decision to add the sick leave bill to the mix, and only three of them voted for that resolution. They said the Biden administration’s own special board of arbitrators recommended higher wages to compensate the unions for not including sick time in its recommendations.“Why do we even have the system set up the way it is if Congress is going to come in and make changes to all of the recommendations?” said Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo.Pelosi sought to position Democrats and the Biden administration as defenders of unions, but she said Congress needed to intervene to avoid a strike.“Families wouldn’t be able to buy groceries or life-saving medications because it would be even more expensive and perishable goods would spoil before reaching shelves,” Pelosi said.The compromise agreement that was supported by the railroads and a majority of the unions provides for 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses retroactive to 2020 along with one additional paid leave day. The raises would be the biggest rail workers have received in more than four decades. Workers would have to pay a larger share of their health insurance costs, but their premiums would be capped at 15% of the total cost of the insurance plan. The agreement did not resolve workers’ concerns about schedules that make it hard to take a day off and the lack of more paid sick time.On several past occasions, Congress has intervened in labor disputes by enacting legislation to delay or prohibit railway and airline strikes.-- The Associated PressIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we

"The list ranking the most on-time, reliable airlines, according to federal data",Nerd Wallet,Business,"Dec. 01, 2022, 10:55 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 7:28 a.m.",0,"Travelers wait for boarding to begin in LaGuardia Airport's Terminal B, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2022, in New York. Travel experts say the ability of many people to work remotely is letting them take off early for Thanksgiving or return home later. Crowds are expected to rival those of 2019, the last Thanksgiving before the pandemic. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)APNEW!By Nerd WalletWhen booking a flight, you want the option that will get you and your stuff where you want to go — preferably on time. Unfortunately, that’s not been a given recently.Airline performance has struggled over the past year as passengers flock back to the skies. According to Transportation Security Administration screening data, almost 11 million more passengers traveled in June 2022 compared with June 2021.To see which airlines handled these turbulent times best, NerdWallet dug into data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to analyze the on-time percentage, cancellation rate, flight diversions, mishandled baggage, tarmac delays and involuntary denied boardings to determine the most reliable airlines in the U.S. for 2022.For an airline to be eligible for our analysis, it had to be based in the U.S. and have a publicly available rewards search calendar with availability from 15 days to eight months from the time of search.We used percentages and rates to avoid penalizing airlines with larger operations. For example, Delta Air Lines may have had more cancellations than the smaller Frontier, but as a percentage of all operated flights, Frontier had a higher cancellation rate.Here’s a breakdown of the winners and losers in each category.On-time percentageAn airline’s on-time percentage is perhaps the most important statistic for showing how well an airline performs. After all, this is a factor that affects every passenger on the plane.The Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracked the percentage of flights that arrive at the destination gate less than 15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time, which it considers “on-time.”Based on BTS data from July 2021 to June 2022, two airlines topped an 80% on-time percentage. Hawaiian Airlines took the top prize with 86%. Delta Air Lines landed just behind Hawaiian with an 84% on-time percentage.The worst performers were JetBlue Airways — with 65% of flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time — and Frontier Airlines, with a 69% on-time percentage. That means more than 1 of every 3 JetBlue flights was delayed by more than 15 minutes during this period.Flight cancellationsWhile a delayed flight is bad, a canceled flight can cause much more havoc to travel plans.Flight cancellations require rebooking on a new flight and could potentially mean dealing with buying overpriced airport food or finding last-minute overnight lodging.BTS data from July 2021 to June 2022 shows Hawaiian performed best of all U.S. airlines with just a 0.81% cancellation rate. Delta took second place again — with a cancellation rate of 1.63%. Meanwhile, merger partners JetBlue (3.81%) and Spirit Airlines (4.11%) canceled the highest percentage of all flights.Note that the flight cancellation data includes flights that are canceled seven days or less before departure only. That means this metric doesn’t penalize airlines that reschedule or cancel flights more than a week ahead of departure.Mishandled luggageDo you check or carry on your bags? If you’re Team Carry-On, you might not care how often airlines lose travelers’ bags. But how well an airline handles luggage is an important factor for those who want to travel with full-size toiletries or who don’t want to lug their luggage through the airport.Yet again, Hawaiian took top marks from July 2021 to June 2022 with 0.28% of checked bags mishandled according to BTS data. Put another way, around 1 of every 357 bags checked on Hawaiian Airlines were lost, delayed or mishandled. Frontier (0.36%) and Southwest Airlines (0.43%) round out the podium on the mishandled bags metric.Oneworld alliance partners American Airlines (0.84%) and Alaska Airlines (0.70%) were the worst-performing airlines for mishandled luggage during the period analyzed. American also mishandled the most number of checked bags in the same time period: 897,345.Flight diversionsPerhaps even worse than a canceled flight is when a flight is diverted to an airport other than the destination airport. And unfortunately, this isn’t as rare as you might think. Across the largest U.S. airlines, around 0.24% of flights were diverted from July 2021 to June 2022. That’s around 1 in every 416 scheduled flights.BTS data for the same period shows that Hawaiian diverted 62 flights — for a diversion rate of 0.08% — or 1 of every 1,165 scheduled flights. Frontier took second place at 0.15%. Meanwhile, JetBlue was the worst performer with 1,091 diverted flights during this period for a diversion rate of 0.43% — or 1 of every 232 scheduled flights.Other performance metricsTo round out our analysis, we also looked at the number of tarmac delays and involuntary denied boardings.Airlines must report when a flight has a “tarmac delay” of over three hours for a domestic flight and over four hours on an international flight. From July 2021 to June 2022, Hawaiian was the only major U.S. airline to avoid having a single tarmac delay. Meanwhile, Delta had 92 tarmac delays — including one delay of nearly seven hours.An involuntary denied boarding happens when an airline oversells a flight and doesn’t get enough volunteers to take a later flight. Hawaiian didn’t record a single involuntary denied boarding for the period analyzed. On the other end, Frontier denied boarding to 5,657 flyers, while American did the same to 7,912 passengers.The most reliable airline of 2022Hawaiian Airlines performed the best in every metric we checked — from on-time percentage to involuntary denied boardings. That makes Hawaiian Airlines our most reliable airline for 2022 in a landslide.Delta takes second place overall with a No. 2 finish in half of the performance metrics. Alaska finishes in third place due to a strong on-time percentage and low cancellation rate.JetBlue’s performance was the worst of any U.S. airline, with a bottom-three finish in almost all metrics. Based on our weightings, Spirit finishes in second-to-last place, with American and Frontier tying for the third-worst-performing airline.MethodologyFor this analysis, we looked at several types of operations data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that captured performance of U.S. airlines from July 2021 to July 2022.Here is our full dataset for determining the most reliable airlines in 2022.

Our guide to Portland’s best new restaurants begins counting down Monday,Michael Russell,Dining Out,"Dec. 02, 2022, 11:36 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"Phuket Cafe, the latest Portland restaurant from Earl Ninsom, offers modern Thai cuisine with seating in a mock train car built into the parking strip out front.The OregonianNEW!By Michael Russell | The Oregonian/OregonLiveOver the past year, Portland restaurant openings were like a game of musical chairs, only this one had more chairs than players.After a decade and a half of wild growth for a food scene called the nation’s best as recently as 2015, the pandemic brutalized the city in 2020, leaving scores of storefronts without tenants to fill them. Many of those empty restaurants, some in once-prime locations, were filled this year with itinerant pop-ups and former food carts, small businesses happy to accept friendly terms on a previously unattainable address.This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. More opportunity has meant more experimentation — Indian fusion brunch! Manga-inspired ramen! Royal Thai cuisine! — with unknown chefs opening their dream concepts with little money down. If you felt a sameness creeping over local restaurants through the 2010s, as big groups stamped out safe, formulaic restaurants in each of Portland’s six quadrants, 2022 represented an exciting moment to eat out.But it also meant plenty of misfires — carts that couldn’t scale up, pop-ups that never popped, newcomers that vanished faster than a flurry of late-fall snow. I’m usually able to come up with a list of 40 new restaurant nominees for our best new restaurant guide each year, some good, some great, some merely intriguing. This year, after trying out more than 70 new places, I had to stretch to find 25.On the brighter side, those restaurants that do survive have a chance to become the next Pok Pok, Le Pigeon or Beast, places that helped build and define the local food landscape for more than a decade.Starting Monday, I’ll begin publishing my annual guide to Portland’s best new restaurants, culminating with our Restaurant of the Year on Dec. 16. All of these restaurants opened — or expanded to full service after a limited COVID opening — between November 2021 and October 2022. Hopefully, it won’t just be a handy list of places to get a good meal, but a glimpse into the future of Portland dining.Read more:Portland’s 25 best new restaurants of 2022— Michael RussellIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",178,"'16':332 '2010s':172 '2015':75 '2020':82 '2021':350 '2022':188,353,387 '25':382 '25.on':272 '40':237 '70':263 'abl':229 'accept':120 'account':398 'address.this':127 'also':197 'annual':315 'bad':132 'beast':293 'becom':285 'begin':312 'best':71,243,320,383 'big':174 'brighter':274 'brunch':142 'brutal':78 'build':297 'built':21 'busi':117 'cafe':2 'call':67 'car':20 'cart':115,202 'chair':46,52 'chanc':283 'chef':152 'citi':80 'come':231 'compens':410 'concept':156 'couldn':204 'covid':346 'creep':166 'cuisin':13,149 'culmin':323 'dec':331 'decad':56 'decade.starting':308 'defin':299 'dining.read':378 'dream':155 'earl':8 'eat':194 'empti':95 'excit':191 'expand':339 'experiment':139 'fall':224 'faster':217 'felt':163 'fill':90,104 'find':271 'flurri':220 'food':65,114,302 'former':113 'formula':179 'friend':121 'front.the':27 'full':341 'fusion':141 'futur':375 'game':43 'get':366 'glimps':372 'good':250,368 'great':252 'group':175 'growth':62 'guid':246,316 'half':59 'handi':361 'happi':118 'help':296 'hope':354 'indian':140 'inspir':145 'intrigu':255 'isn':128 'itiner':108 'landscap':303 'late':223 'late-fal':222 'latest':4 'le':290 'leav':83 'like':41 'limit':345 'link':403 'list':235,362 'littl':158 'll':311 'local':168,301 'locat':102 'm':227 'manga':144 'manga-inspir':143 'mani':92 'may':408 'meal':369 'meant':137,198 'mere':254 'michael':30,388 'misfir':201 'mock':18 'modern':11 'moment':192 'monday':309 'money':159 'music':45 'nation':69 'necessarili':130 'never':212 'new':238,244,264,321,384 'newcom':214 'next':287 'ninsom':9 'nomine':240 'novemb':349 'octob':352 'offer':10 'once-prim':99 'one':49,400 'open':39,153,337,347 'opportun':135 'oregonian/oregonliveover':33 'oregoniannew':28 'out.but':195 'pandem':77 'park':24 'past':35 'phuket':1 'pigeon':291 'place':265,294,364 'players.after':54 'plenti':199 'pok':288,289 'pop':110,209,213 'pop-up':109,208 'portland':5,37,184,318,377,380 'previous':125 'prime':101 'product':393 'publish':313 'purchas':391 'quadrant':187 'ramen':146 'receiv':409 'recent':73 'regist':395 'repres':189 'restaur':6,38,96,169,180,239,245,277,322,326,336,385 'royal':147 'russel':31 'russellif':389 'safe':178 'same':165 'scale':206 'scene':66 'score':84 'seat':15 'servic':342 'side':275 'site':406 'six':186 'small':116 'snow':225 'stamp':176 'storefront':86 'stretch':269 'strip':25 'surviv':280 'tenant':88 'term':122 'thai':12,148 'thing':133 'train':19 'tri':259 'unattain':126 'unknown':151 'up':111,210 'usual':228 'vanish':216 'wild':61 'without':87 'won':356 'year':36,106,248,257,329","{""The Oregonian""}"
"2022 holiday mailing, shipping deadlines are sneaking up on us for gifts, packages","Marc Bona, cleveland.com",Advice,"Dec. 02, 2022, 10:26 a.m.","Dec. 02, 2022, 5:13 a.m.",0,"Our annual guide for holiday shipping deadlines is out, with important dates, packing tips, historical tidbits, trivia and more. Here’s what to know for the 2022 holidays.NEW!By Marc Bona, cleveland.comAnnual holiday-mailing deadlines are out and ensuring you meet them will avoid Christmas morning disasters.Dates to knowUSPS deadlines to arrive by Christmas Day:Retail Ground: Saturday, Dec. 17.First-Class: Saturday, Dec. 17.Chanukkah is Sunday, Dec. 18.Priority Mail: Monday, Dec. 19.Priority Mail Express: Friday, Dec. 23.Christmas Eve is Saturday, Dec. 24.Christmas Day is Sunday, Dec. 25.Service: USPS offices and most services will not be open Dec. 25, Dec. 26 (Christmas holiday observed), Jan. 1 and Jan. 2 (New Year’s Day observed). USPS Priority Mail will be delivered, though.More deadlines: Additional USPS deadlines for overseas and military shipping can be found online. Deadlines for private companies like DHL, Fed Ex and UPS also are online. Also, dealhack.com – which focuses on store discounts and promo codes – also lists shipping deadlines.Busy timeBusiest time of the year for the Postal Service is the week of Dec. 12-17, when a “high volume” of mail is expected, USPS spokeswoman Naddia Dhalai said. The Postal Service has installed 137 additional machines throughout the United States to increase processing capacity to 60 million packages a day. More people ordering online, Dhalai said, means increased package volume. The Postal Service even has an online counter so you see how many packages are being delivered; go to https://about.usps.com/holidaynews/.Receiving tips• Informed Delivery offers a chance to see a photo of what is headed to your home. “Everything that comes to the mail every day, they’ll get a picture of it. So they’ll know what’s coming to their mailbox,” Dhalai said. Usually the email with photo will be sent in the morning. So if you are going to be out and you are anticipating an important package, you can have a neighbor or friend be on the lookout.Christmas stampsAPHow much are stamps?First-Class stamps cost 60 cents. Post-card stamps are 44 cents.2022 holiday stamps• Holiday Elves• Snowy Beauty• Winter Blooms• Hanukkah• KwanzaaHoliday cards date to the 1840s.APPacking tips• Boxes should be double corrugated. New is preferred. If you are recycling a box, examine it to ensure it is in good shape. Don’t try to salvage flimsy ones. Break it down and recycle.• Don’t overpack. If the box bulges, that is not good.• If an item rattles in the box, it’s not packed well.• Wrap items separately. And always wrap glass separately, no matter how large or small the item.• You should allow at least a 2-inch space around items for packing / cushioning materials.• Do you shred documents? The strands make good packing fodder.• If shipping clothes, papers or anything that could be ruined by moisture, place the items in heavy-duty plastic, or at least double bags. Use softer items as protection for more delicate things.• Put addressee’s name and address inside the package. If you are printing a mailing label, you can print a duplicate, or jot the info.• If you are mailing via USPS boxes, make sure your item will fit into the slot. They should weigh no more than 10 ounces and be a half-inch thick or less. For more box restrictions, go online.• If your item is breakable, write “fragile.” But don’t doodle cute pictures all over the box. Make it clean so postal workers can read it quickly.• Non-lithium batteries should be left in original packaging. Do not put them in devices like toys before mailing. A device could turn on in transit, causing security concerns. Batteries in any item should be removed and sent separately.Deadlines are coming for mailing packages in time to arrive by Christmas.AP• Consider media mail (cheaper but slower), but know restrictions. It’s limited to books, sound recordings (CDs, DVDs), manuscripts, play scripts, printed music, some films, loose-leaf pages and binders with medical information and more. Advertising, video games and comic books are among the restricted items. Check online for complete list.• Two-inch wide tape is best. Do not use masking, cellophane or duct tape. Tape side seams first, then across the top. Reinforce bottom flaps.• If a box has tape, make sure its adhesive sticks. Strands sticking out can be accidentally ripped off and take cardboard with them, leaving a hole or weakening a side.• Avoid brown paper as a mailing wrapper. Labels can be torn, paper can rip. And no string, rope, cord or twine, which can muck up postal machinery. It makes for an old-fashioned look – but impractical.• Write neatly or print labels with clean fonts, nothing fancy. Remember: It’s a package, not a formal invitation. Consider proper fonts. American Typewriter makes for a good look.• Remove previous labels. Black out notations, names, codes or addresses with magic marker.• Do not write “to” and “from” all over your box. Use one side only.• Edit your label. Did you leave off a zip code, a return address, apartment number?• Know zip codes. Look them up. If you know the +4 code, use it. No zip is better than a wrong one.• If you are using self-serve USPS kiosks, make extra sure the address is correct. A clerk will look, but at the kiosk it’s on you.Letters to SantaWant to write Santa Claus? Deadline to receive a USPS North Pole postmark is to mail by Monday, Dec. 12.What you need• Child’s letter• Reply letter• Two different writing utensils• Standard envelope with postage• Larger envelope with postageWhat to do• Have the child write to Santa. Put the note in an envelope addressed to Santa Claus, North Pole.• Without the little one noticing, write a personalized response. Sign it, “From Santa.”• Insert both letters into an envelope addressed to the child.• Add the return address - Santa, North Pole - to the envelope.• Put First Class Mail stamp on the envelope.• Place the complete envelope into a larger envelope, with appropriate postage. Send to North Pole Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr., Anchorage AK 99530-9998.• Santa-letter tips: Write Santa’s response on the back of your child’s letter so your little one can recall what he or she wrote. When responding as Santa, make the note personal: Highlight your child’s accomplishments and activities over the year. Remember: Disguise your handwriting.Buy 'Forever' stamps, and be nice to carriers.APThree final tips• ‘Forever’ stamps remain valid at the price you paid. So if you purchase them a couple of years ago at 55 cents, you’re OK to use them now, even though the price is 60 cents.• Consider buying cards immediately after Christmas for the following holiday. Upside: At this time, prices often plummet. Downside: Pickings are slim.• Holidays can be stressful. Supply-chain issues, financial challenges and other issues can crop up. Don’t take it out on your local carrier or clerk. Be nice. And keep the area near your mailbox clear.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",180,"'+4':861 '-17':177 '-9998':1025

San Francisco will allow police to deploy robots that kill,The Associated Press,Public Safety,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 8:28 a.m.",215,"San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott answers questions during a news conference May 2019. (Eric Risberg, Associated Press file photo)NEW!215sharesBy The Associated PressSupervisors in San Francisco voted Tuesday to give city police the ability to use potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations -- following an emotionally charged debate that reflected divisions on the politically liberal board over support for law enforcement.The vote was 8-3, with the majority agreeing to grant police the option despite strong objections from civil liberties and other police oversight groups. Opponents said the authority would lead to the further militarization of a police force already too aggressive with poor and minority communities.Supervisor Connie Chan, a member of the committee that forwarded the proposal to the full board, said she understood concerns over use of force but that “according to state law, we are required to approve the use of these equipments. So here we are, and it’s definitely not a easy discussion.”The San Francisco Police Department said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.“Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives,” she said.Supervisors amended the proposal Tuesday to specify that officers could use robots only after using alternative force or de-escalation tactics, or concluding they would not be able to subdue the suspect through those alternative means. Only a limited number of high-ranking officers could authorize use of robots as a deadly force option.San Francisco police currently have a dozen functioning ground robots used to assess bombs or provide eyes in low visibility situations, the department says. They were acquired between 2010 and 2017, and not once have they been used to deliver an explosive device, police officials said.But explicit authorization was required after a new California law went into effect this year requiring police and sheriffs departments to inventory military-grade equipment and seek approval for their use.The state law was authored last year by San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu while he was an assembly member. It is aimed at giving the public a forum and voice in the acquisition and use of military-grade weapons that have a negative effect on communities, according to the legislation.A federal program has long dispensed grenade launchers, camouflage uniforms, bayonets, armored vehicles and other surplus military equipment to help local law enforcement.In 2017, then-President Donald Trump signed an order reviving the Pentagon program after his predecessor, Barack Obama, curtailed it in 2015, triggered in part by outrage over the use of military gear during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown.San Francisco police said late Tuesday that no robots were obtained from military surplus, but some were purchased with federal grant money.Like many places around the U.S., San Francisco is trying to balance public safety with treasured civilian rights such as privacy and the ability to live free of excessive police oversight. In September, supervisors agreed to a trial run allowing police to access in real time private surveillance camera feeds in certain circumstances.Debate on Tuesday ran more than two hours with members on both sides accusing the other of reckless fear mongering.Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who voted in favor of the policy authorization, said he was troubled by rhetoric painting the police department as untrustworthy and dangerous.“I think there’s larger questions raised when progressives and progressive policies start looking to the public like they are anti-police,” he said. “I think that is bad for progressives. I think it’s bad for this Board of Supervisors. I think it’s bad for Democrats nationally.”Board President Shamann Walton, who voted against the proposal, pushed back, saying it made him not anti-police, but “pro people of color.”“We continuously are being asked to do things in the name of increasing weaponry and opportunities for negative interaction between the police department and people of color,” he said. “This is just one of those things.”The San Francisco Public Defender’s office sent a letter Monday to the board saying that granting police “the ability to kill community members remotely” goes against the city’s progressive values. The office wanted the board to reinstate language barring police from using robots against any person in an act of force.On the other side of the San Francisco Bay, the Oakland Police Department has dropped a similar proposal after public backlash.The first time a robot was used to deliver explosives in the U.S. was in 2016, when Dallas police sent in an armed robot that killed a holed-up sniper who had killed five officers in an ambush.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",33,"'-3':69 '2010':324 '2015':467

(Photo: Netflix) NetflixNEW!By Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLiveWhile many aspects of holiday celebrations are returning to something resembling pre-pandemic  levels, the allure of staying close to home is still strong for some of us. Fortunately, streaming services are busy, offering ways to watch holiday favorites, new TV series and some recent movies that are making their way to home screens. Here’s a look at some of the choices available this 2022 season.HOLIDAY FAVORITES“A Charlie Brown Christmas”: For many of us, it’s not the holidays without an annual re-watch of the special featuring “Peanuts” characters created by the late Charles Schulz. The 1965 animated classic isn’t airing on broadcast TV this year, news that brings out the Grinch in us. But you can stream it, on Apple TV Plus. The special isn’t streaming anywhere else. Good grief! (Streaming on Apple TV Plus, which offers a free trial)“The Great British Baking Show: Holidays”: The 2022 seasonal special edition features two episodes. In one, actors from the U.K.-produced miniseries, “It’s a Sin,” are called on to prepare such items as pies consisting of what you might find in their fridge as leftovers, “boozy” Yule Logs, and edible Christmas trees. Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith are on hand, along with cohosts Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas. The second holiday episode brings back some familiar faces from past seasons, who try to whip up standout New Year breakfast buns, a “biscuit-based winter diorama,” and more. (Currently streaming on Netflix)Hallmark “Countdown to Christmas” movies: This year, Peacock, the NBCUniversal streaming service, is streaming live and on-demand programming from Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries and Hallmark Drama. That means that the ever-popular “Countdown to Christmas” Hallmark TV movie can be viewed live on Peacock as they premiere. The films will also be available on-demand from Peacock for 72 hours after they air live. (Streaming on Peacock)OREGON CONNECTIONS“Wendell & Wild”: This sometimes funny, sometimes creepy tale is an example of top-of-the-line stop-motion animation artistry, and testament to area talent, since much of the film was made in Portland. It’s also the first feature directed by Henry Selick since “Coraline,” the 2009 stop-motion animated feature that was the first movie released by the Hillsboro-based Laika animation studio.The film reunites the “Key & Peele” duo of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, who provide the voices of a pair of brothers who are frustrated with being demons and yearn to return to the land of the living. Their scheme intersects with Kat (voiced by Lyric Ross), a young woman who, after her parents die in a car crash, has gotten into trouble with the juvenile justice and is sent to a Catholic school in a supposed “Break the Cycle” program.Peele is also a producer and co-writer, with Selick, and the film’s story, with its attention to multicultural characters and injustice (the bad guys scheme to destroy the heroine’s hometown so they can build a cruelly run private prison), recalls how Peele blends genre storytelling and social issues in such films as “Get Out” and “Us.” (Streaming on Netflix)“Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio”: Like “Wendell & Wild,” “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” was largely made in Portland, and it’s another dazzling example of stop-motion animated storytelling at its best. Co-directed by del Toro (the Oscar-winning director of “The Shape of Water”) and Portland-based filmmaker Mark Gustafson (animation director of “Fantastic Mr. Fox”), this “Pinocchio” is often dark, and intense. But it’s also beautifully made, and rich with emotion.Carlo Collodi’s 1883 novel about Geppetto, a woodcarver who makes a wooden puppet called Pinocchio, has been adapted many times. In this version, co-written by del Toro and Patrick McHale, the story is set in Mussolini’s 1930s Italy, in the Fascist-controlled days leading up to World War II. The splendid voice cast includes David Bradley, Gregory Mann, Tilda Swinton, Ron Perlman, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett and Ewan McGregor as Sebastian J. Cricket, who provides narration and also gets involved in Pinocchio’s adventures. (In some theaters; streaming Dec. 9 on Netflix)The late Jessi Combs is the subject of the documentary, ""The Fastest Woman on Earth."" (Photo: Courtesy of HBO Max)“The Fastest Woman on Earth”: This documentary, filmed over the course of several years, focuses on Jessi Combs, and her career and a professional racer and a TV personality known for such programs as “Mythbusters.” Combs died in 2019, as the custom car she was driving in an attempt to break the world land speed record crashed in Oregon’s Alvord Desert. Filmmakers Chris Otwell and Graham Suorsa provide a sensitive look at Combs, and the challenges she faced as a woman pursuing her goals in a field dominated by men. Affecting though the film is, viewers should be warned that there is footage of Combs inside the vehicle, and images of the aftermath of the fatal crash. Experts say the footage shows that Combs was doing everything she was supposed to be doing, but these sequences are difficult to watch. (Streaming on HBO Max)Dominic West as Prince Charles and Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana in ""The Crown' Season 5. (Photo: Keith Bernstein/Netflix)Keith BernsteinTV CHOICES“The Crown”: Peter Morgan’s drama series inspired by Queen Elizabeth II and those in the orbit of the Royal Family, has been mesmerizing viewing for most of its first four seasons. Unfortunately, Season 5 -- the first to arrive following the death of Queen Elizabeth -- is by far the weakest outing yet. These episodes, set in the 1990s, deal with events many of us remember all too well. Perhaps that sense of overkill -- hasn’t the disastrous marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana been amply chronicled already? -- adds to the general depressing atmosphere.It doesn’t help that the major roles have been, again, recast, and as talented as the new actors are, they seem uncomfortable. Imelda Staunton’s Elizabeth is generally portrayed as oblivious and a monarch whose popularity is slipping as she seems totally out of touch with changes rocking the shrinking Empire. Morgan seems to be making the season something of a Charles Reclamation Project, as Dominic West’s Prince of Wales is seen as dynamic, ready to rule and so hip he actually gets down and dances with disadvantaged young people at an event connected to Charles’ charity, the Prince’s Trust. (Reports indicate this jaw-dropping scene has roots in reality, but it still sticks out as embarrassing.)Elizabeth Debicki inherits the role of Diana, who, in this season, comes off as both angry at how she feels she’s been treated by the Royals, and self-pitying. Debicki tries, but she overdoes the exterior Diana mannerisms, and doesn’t seem to connect to the woman within. The rest of the cast does their best, but the 10 episodes feel disjointed and anti-climactic. (Streaming on Netflix)Kevin Costner as John Dutton in ""Yellowstone."" (Photo courtesy Paramount Network)“Yellowstone”: The contemporary Western has returned for Season 5 with more huge ratings, as fans devour weekly episodes about the Dutton family, their relationship dramas, and their efforts to protect the family’s vast Montana ranch at all costs. So far in Season 5, viewers have seen ranching patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner) take office as governor of Montana, where he’s wasted no time letting everyone in sight know that he has little respect for how the government traditionally works. Adding to the conflict are ongoing tensions between Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) and Jamie Dutton (Wes Bentley), with Beth vowing to destroy Jamie’s life. Families -- what are you gonna do? (You can watch new “Yellowstone” episodes at 8 p.m. Sundays on the Paramount Network. No cable? You can watch live via Philo, which offers a free trial; fubo TV, which also offers a free trial; and Sling TV, which has promotional offers. You can catch up with Seasons 1-4 on Peacock.)RECENT MOVIES“Don’t Worry Darling”: When this drama opened in theaters, it generated a blizzard of gossip about reports that director Olivia Wilde ended her relationship with Jason Sudeikis (”Ted Lasso”) because she fell in love with Harry Styles, the pop star who is one of the leads in “Don’t Worry Darling.” Then there was the brouhaha over Styles replacing Shia LaBeouf, with Wilde saying she fired LaBeouf because of concerns regarding his behavior and “combative energy.” LBeouf denied claims that he’d been fired, and said he quit the movie. Adding to the bad vibes were reports that star Florence Pugh and Wilde didn’t get along. Somewhere in all this, there’s a movie, a stylized look at couples living in a Stepford-like, perfect-on-the-surface community that is built on secrets. Now that “Don’t Worry Darling” is streaming, you can see the film that sparked tabloid headlines around the world. (Streaming on HBO Max)“Top Gun: Maverick”: The box office dynamo helped lure millions of moviegoers back to cineplexes, to watch Tom Cruise reprise his “Top Gun” role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. The film is a crowd-pleasing epic about Maverick’s new role as a trainer of pilots at the Top Fun fighting school. The cast includes Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris and Glen Powell. (”Top Gun: Maverick” can be rented or bought digitally on platforms including Amazon Prime Video; beginning on Dec. 22, the film will stream on Paramount+.)“Bros”: It didn’t spark the kind of gossip overload of “Don’t Worry Darling,” but “Bros,” starring and co-written by Billy Eichner, did stir up a bit of controversy. The film was promoted by Eichner as one of the few examples of a mainstream romantic comedy focusing on a gay couple. Though adult-skewing fare that doesn’t boast the built-in familiarity of something like “Top Gun: Maverick” has been struggling at the box office, “Bros” first opened in movie theaters, skipping the streaming route that many industry observers thought might have been a better move.“Bros” flopped in cinemas, which Eichner complained about on social media, blaming the poor performance on “straight people” who didn’t show up, and saying that everyone who isn’t “a homophobic weirdo” should see “Bros” in theaters. That response didn’t go over so well. “Bros,” which costars Luke Macfarlane, earned generally positive reviews from critics, and now that it’s coming to a streaming service, more viewers can check it out for themselves, from the comfort of the couch.

"Selling psilocybin isn’t legal in Oregon, but a Portland shop is doing it anyway",Savannah Eadens,Portland,"Dec. 01, 2022, 5:00 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 4:05 p.m.",386,"The logo outside Shroom House, a new storefront at 1541 W. Burnside St., is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”NEW!386sharesBy Savannah Eadens | The Oregonian/OregonLiveCautious but eager customers crowded a bright commercial storefront on West Burnside Street on Thursday.On display were typical items. Supplements. Teas. Chocolates. Even jerky.Plus a not-at-all discreet menu of prices for what the store identifies as different strains of dried psilocybin fungus, including 3.5 grams of “Knobby Tops” for $50 and 7 grams of “Albino Penis Envy” for $95.“Are you looking for a functional micro-dose? Or do you want to go on a hike with some color enhancement and sparkles?” an unidentified employee asked a customer.“I just want to have a normal day, but like with a smile,” a man in line replied.Shroom House, at 1541 W. Burnside St., is branding itself as a wellness shop but is very much selling psilocybin in a dispensary-like setting – a retail format that is not legal in Oregon.Oregon’s legal psilocybin program was created under Measure 109 and passed by voters in 2020. That program will allow people 21 and older to take the substance in a controlled, therapeutic environment under the supervision of trained facilitators when psychedelic mushrooms become legal in January 2023, according to the text of the measure. Measure 109 did not allow for the retail sale of psilocybin.Under Measure 110, effective since early 2021, misdemeanor drug possession including psilocybin can result in police issuing tickets with fines up to $100, but not an arrest.The Oregon Health Authority’s site for the program said it will begin accepting applications for manufacturing licenses on January 2, 2023.The state agency confirmed Oregon has no licensed psilocybin facilitators or service centers at this time. But the agency said it’s not responsible for unregulated activity, including unlicensed possession, sale or consumption of psilocybin.That’s local law enforcement’s job, a health authority spokesperson said.Kevin Allen, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau, said via email Thursday that the agency’s Narcotics and Organized Crime unit is aware of the allegations being made online about the location, but referred questions to the Oregon Health Authority.“The nature of the (Narcotics and Organized Crime unit) work requires them to be pretty cautious about what they release publicly, so I can’t say more than the fact that they’re aware of it,” Allen said.The signage outside the store is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”A menu board at Shroom House, 1541 W. Burnside St., features colorful names for strains of dried magic mushrooms.Shroom House, a Canadian company, calls itself an “online dispensary” with “mail-order magic mushrooms.” Representatives did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment Thursday. The website says users must be 19 or older to access.The Portland storefront appears to have popped up in the past few weeks.Inside, it looks like a dispensary or holistic shop: artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space. They even have T-shirts with the logo.Upon entry, customers are required to show two forms of I.D. – a driver’s license and debit or credit card – and fill out a form listing their name and address. They’re asked to become a member of the “Shroom House Society.”Then they can purchase recreational mushrooms with cash. Of course, there’s an ATM in the corner.Inside the new shrooms vending shop at 1541 W. Burnside St. artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space.On the counter, next to a register, a clear glass jar has a written note taped to it: “A tip for your trip.”“This is crazy, everything Oregon is doing with decriminalization, I love it,” one customer who declined to give his name said on his way out. “I can’t see it being shut down,” he said, when asked if he was concerned about the legitimacy.Other customers inside the store Thursday afternoon expressed anxiety at a TV news crew outside. They said they learned about the shop on Reddit, where a user posted a new Portland billboard advertising the shop.The building at 1541 W. Burnside St. is owned by Sunjoy Realty, LLC, according to Secretary of State records. The property’s building manager, Mark Byrum, said the person who owns the new business started the lease within the past two months.There are no listed business in Oregon registered under the name Shroom House, according to the Secretary of State’s website.– Savannah Eadens; seadens@oregonian.com; 503-221-6651; @savannaheadensReporter Lizzy Acker contributed to this story.Our journalism needs your support.

Mauna Loa vs. Mount St. Helens: How the eruptions differ and what NW volcanoes are doing now,staff and wire reports,Environment,"Nov. 30, 2022, 5:23 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 8:26 a.m.",0,"Lava pours out of the summit crater of Mauna Loa about 6:35 a.m. Monday, Nov. 28, 2022, as seen from Gilbert Kahele Recreation Area on Maunakea, Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano,  began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. (Chelsea Jensen/West Hawaii Today via AP)APNEW!By staff and wire reportsWashington state’s Mount St. Helens erupted catastrophically in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles away.Mauna Loa is not exploding like Mount St. Helens did. The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa and Mount St. Helens erupt in different ways,” said Liz Westby, a geologist based at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington. “Mauna Loa trends toward eruptions of fluid-flowing lava (compositionally called basalt), which over time, has built its broad shield shape.”In contrast, she said, “Mount St. Helens trends toward eruptions of thicker, more viscous lava (compositionally called dacite and andesite) that doesn’t flow very far and can pile up near the vent to form lava domes. Gases can be trapped in the thick and viscous magma as it waits in the shallow magma reservoir and the systems can become pressurized, sometimes leading to explosive eruptions.”Westby added, “With lava flowing from fissures high on the flank of Mauna Loa, the chance of an explosive eruption is greatly diminished (gases are escaping).”Mauna Loa’s hotter, drier and more fluid magma allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is called a shield volcano because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.On Friday, the United States Geological Service posted a routine update on Northwest volcanoes:Activity Update: All volcanoes in the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington are at normal background levels of activity. These include Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams in Washington State; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Newberry, and Crater Lake in Oregon.Recent Observations: Over the past week, earthquakes were located at Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Hood, including a seismic swarm at Mount St. Helens from November 20–21 and a M 2.1 earthquake at Mount Rainier on November 21. These earthquakes are consistent with background levels of seismicity at each volcano. Activity at other Cascade volcanoes is also at background levels.Westby noted Mauna Loa has historically had explosive eruptions, although not like Mount St. Helens’ 1980 lateral blast, and Mount St. Helens has had fluid flows of basalt. The Ape Cave lava tube on the south side of Mount St. Helens is an example of a basalt flow, she said.New Webcam shows fissure 3!! https://t.co/nWh9jyd4XJNWRZ eruption #MaunaLoa continues.

On the Big Island, the first eruption in 38 years of the world’s largest active volcano dredged up bad memories among some Hawaii residents who have been through harrowing volcanic experiences in the past.It was just four years ago that Nicole Skilling fled her home near a community where more than 700 residences were destroyed by lava. She relocated to the South Kona area, only to find herself packing her car with food and supplies this week after Mauna Loa erupted late Sunday.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks. Hon expects the current eruption to follow this pattern.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",97,"' ':587,622,662,681,717,736,749,760,772,805,814,851,865,880 '-':670 '/jbuqodrb4f':567 '/nwh9jyd4xjnwrz':532 '00 ':627,691 '000':97 '022

"As Hawaii volcano Mauna Loa erupts, officials warn residents to prepare to flee",The Associated Press,Environment,"Nov. 29, 2022, 12:40 p.m.","Nov. 28, 2022, 4:42 p.m.",0,"The ground is shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating that it could erupt. Scientists say they don't expect that to happen right away but officials on the Big Island of Hawaii are telling residents to be prepared in case it does erupt soon. This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island.APNEW!By The Associated PressWaves of orange, glowing lava and smoky ash erupted Monday from the world’s largest active volcano and people living on Hawaii’s Big Island were warned to be ready if their communities are threatened.The eruption of Mauna Loa wasn’t immediately endangering towns, but officials told residents to be ready to evacuate if lava flows started heading toward populated areas.Many now living in the area weren’t around when Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. The U.S. Geological Survey warned the roughly 200,000 people on the Big Island that an eruption “can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly.”Lifelong Big Island resident Bobby Camara, who lives in Volcano Village, said everyone across the island should be alert and keep track of the eruption.“I think everybody should be a little bit concerned,” he said. “We don’t know where the flow is going, we don’t know how long it’s going to last.”He said he’s seen three Mauna Loa eruptions in his lifetime and knows that people need to be vigilant.The eruption began late Sunday night following a series of fairly large earthquakes, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.Gunner Mench, who owns an art gallery in Kamuela, said he awoke shortly after midnight and saw an alert on his phone about the eruption.Mench and his wife, Ellie, ventured out to film the eruption’s eerie red glow over the island and watched as the lava spilled down the side of the volcano.“You could see it spurting up into the air, over the edge of this depression,” Mench said.“Right now it’s just entertainment, but the concern is” it could reach populated areas, he said.Lava pours out of the summit crater of Mauna Loa about 6:35 a.m. Monday, Nov. 28, 2022, as seen from Gilbert Kahele Recreation Area on Maunakea, Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano,  began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. (Chelsea Jensen/West Hawaii Today via AP)APThere’s been a surge of development on the Big Island in recent decades — its population has more than doubled, from 92,000 in 1980.More than a third of the island’s residents live either in the city of Kailua-Kona to the west of the volcano, which has about 23,000 people, and Hilo to the east, with about 45,000. Officials were most worried about several subdivisions about 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south of the volcano, which are home to about 5,000 people.A time-lapse video of the eruption from overnight showed lava lighting up one area, moving across it like waves on the ocean.The U.S. Geological Survey said that the eruption had migrated to a rift zone on the volcano’s northeast flank. Rift zones are where the mountain rock is cracked and relatively weak — making it easier for magma to emerge.An eruption from the northeast could send lava toward the county seat of Hilo or other towns in East Hawaii but it could take the lava weeks or months to reach populated areas. It’s possible the eruption may later shift to a rift zone on the southwest flank. Lava emerging from this area could reach nearby communities in hours or days.“We don’t want to try and second-guess the volcano,” Hon said. “We have to let it actually show us what it’s going to do and then we inform people of what is happening ASAP.”Hawaii County Civil Defense announced that it had opened shelters because it had reports of people evacuating from along the coast on their own initiative.The average Mauna Loa eruption is not typically prolonged, lasting a couple of weeks, Hon said.“Typically, Mauna Loa eruptions start off with the heaviest volume first,” Hon said. “After a few days, it starts to calm down a little bit.”The USGS warned residents who could be threatened by Mauna Loa lava flows to review their eruption preparations. Scientists had been on alert because of a recent spike in earthquakes at the summit of the volcano, which last erupted in 1984.Portions of the Big Island were under an ashfall advisory issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu, which said up to a quarter-inch (0.6 centimeters) of ash could accumulate in some areas.Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago.Mauna Loa, rising 13,679 feet (4,169 meters) above sea level, is the much larger neighbor of Kilauea, which erupted in a residential neighborhood and destroyed 700 homes in 2018. Some of Mauna Loa’s slopes are much steeper than Kilauea’s, so lava can flow much faster when it erupts.During a 1950 eruption, the mountain’s lava traveled 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the ocean in fewer than three hours.Tourism is Hawaii’s economic engine but Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth predicted few problems for those on vacation during the eruption.“It will be spectacular where it is, but the chances of it really interrupting the visitor industry — very, very slim,” he said.For some, the eruption might cut down on some travel time, even if there is more volcanic smog caused by higher sulfur-dioxide emissions.“But the good thing is you don’t have to drive from Kona over to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to see an eruption anymore,” Roth said. “You can just look out your window at night and you’ll be able to see Mauna Loa erupting.”Julia Neal, owner of Pahala Plantation Cottages, said the eruption brings some relief after many preparedness meetings, and much wondering about what the volcano will do.“It’s exciting,” she said. “It’s kind of a relief that it’s happening and we’re not waiting for it to happen.”A few future guests from the U.S. mainland called Neal “asking me to make a prediction, which I can’t,” she said. “So I said, just stand by.”___Associated Press writers Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu, Alina Hartounian in Phoenix and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage,

"Ask Amy: Readers share stories, advice about what might happen after a DNA search",Amy Dickinson,Advice,,"Dec. 03, 2022, 12:09 a.m.",0,"Amy Dickinson writes the syndicated Ask Amy column.Tribune Content AgencyNEW!By Amy DickinsonDear Readers: Often, readers reply to dilemmas posed in my column in ways that are helpful, useful, and inspiring. Today’s column is devoted to some of these replies. As always, I’m grateful for readers who share their own stories.Dear Amy: “Tell or Not Tell” wondered about disclosing the sexual abuse she had survived as a child to the man she was dating.I had been divorced for five years when I went on a first date with a man I had just met.On our way to the restaurant, we were stuck in traffic behind a car with a bumper sticker that said “Help Stamp Out Child Abuse.”“Why would someone put a bumper sticker like that on their car?” he asked.I thought for a moment before answering and said, “I suppose the car belongs to someone like me who was molested as a child.”My date didn’t ask for any more details at that moment because he was trying not to wreck the car.I knew from his instantly shocked reaction that this was a man with whom my children would be safe, and he has been — for 37 years now.So I vote that this woman should tell him and see what happens.What he says and does next will tell her exactly what she needs to know.– Found a Good OneDear Found: This brings tears to my eyes. Thank you.Dear Amy: Responding to questions about DNA disclosures, my wife found out that her father was not her biological parent when she had her DNA analyzed by a family historical research company.It came as quite a shock. Both her mother and father have been dead for some time.My wife has been more hurt from finding out this way, as opposed to being told by her mother.Her two brothers also took DNA tests and they all discovered that her older brother was also fathered by another man.I’ve told my wife it is possible that her mother did not know exactly who had fathered her children, so it’s best not to be too judgmental about all of this.To me it sounds like she was a very unhappy woman, and she may have been looking for love in all the wrong places.Your advice to inform people about DNA findings is solid, and my spouse wholeheartedly agrees.– Embracing AnswersDear Embracing: DNA discoveries are forcing many families to re-imagine their histories.Dear Amy: A reader named “Selfish” wondered when it might be too late to send or receive a letter of condolence after a death in the family.When our youngest son was killed five weeks before his 19th birthday, we received hundreds of notes and sympathy cards.While we greatly appreciated all of the condolences we received at the time of our son’s death, the note we got six months later was the one that stood out the most to us.We felt extra supported to know that someone else remembered that while the world moved on, our life had been turned upside down and that we continued to be devastated and grieve the loss of our child.For those who grieve, any time would be considered “timely” to know that others are remembering them in their loss.– SupportedDear Supported: I hope your testimony will inspire people to reach out to those who grieve – no matter how much time has passed.Dear Amy: Your column frequently reflects the many ways in which families are made, and how to discuss DNA disclosures, sperm and egg donation, and adoption within the family.We adopted a child 26 years ago.Ours was an open adoption and our unfailing motto was that no child can have too much love.From the beginning of our time together, when our daughter was a baby, we used pictures to tell our beautiful daughter her origin story.As she matured, the story matured.I hope this idea is helpful to some of your readers who don’t feel able to tell their child they weren’t conceived biologically.Our daughter recently got married and as she exchanged vows with her husband, her father and I, her brothers, her birth grandparents, birth mother, birth mother’s siblings and children formed the circle of love that surrounded her.The bride was radiant. She knows who she is.– Proud ParentDear Proud: “She knows who she is.” Beautiful. Tackling ever-changing questions about identity is one of the burdens of being human. Your loving, open, and honest attitude has made this much easier for everyone in your wide family circle.You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

Conservation group asks Oregon to revoke approvals for renewable diesel refinery on Columbia River,Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive,Business,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",112,"A rendering of the proposed renewable diesel refinery at Port Westward industrial park outside Clatskanie.NEW!112sharesBy Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLiveConservationists this week asked Oregon regulators to revoke state authorizations for a $2 billion-plus renewable diesel refinery proposed on the Columbia River near Clatskanie.Columbia Riverkeeper, which opposes siting the controversial renewable diesel refinery in the Columbia River estuary, argues that approval of the project should be called into question following a key decision in October by the state Land Use Board of Appeals.Columbia County commissioners in February approved land use permits for the project’s backer, Houston-based NEXT Renewables. But conservation groups and a local resident appealed that decision to the state land board, which ruled in late October that a proposed rail yard at the facility is not allowed on agricultural land, as planned.Columbia Riverkeeper is now arguing that the land use decision undercuts an air quality permit for the facility that the Department of Environmental Quality approved in August and a previously granted exemption from obtaining a site permit from the Department of Energy. Both of those are predicated on having land use approval from the county, so Columbia Riverkeeper believes they should be revoked.Michael Hinrichs, a spokesperson for the projects’ backers, Houston-based NEXT Renewables, said Columbia Riverkeeper is wrong. NEXT Renewables obtained two separate land use approvals from the county – one for the rail yard and another for the refining facility. The air quality permit is linked to the refinery not the rail yard, he said, so is not impacted by the land use decision.NEXT Renewables will redesign the rail yard so it conforms with land use laws and reapply for a new approval from the county, he added.“Columbia Riverkeeper’s claims are either disingenuous or simply uninformed,” Hinrichs said in an email.He pointed to a memo that DEQ Interim Director Leah Feldman sent to members of the Environmental Quality Commission in advance of the policy setting board’s regular meeting in mid-November that said the land use decision “does not affect” the air permit.Columbia Riverkeeper said it’s aware of the agency’s position, but believes it’s wrong.Dan Serres, conservation director for the group, said the rail facility is an integral part of the project, required for the delivery of feedstocks and other refinery supplies. The air permit, he said, lists the proposed rail activities as a source of emissions. Moreover, in a request for information to the company for another major permit, a water quality certification, DEQ said that consistency with land use regulations would require approvals for both the rail yard and refinery.“Bottom line: the refinery can’t operate without the rail yard,” Serres said in an email. “A company should not receive air or water permits in a situation where the underlying land use authorization is invalid.”DEQ spokesperson Lauren Wirtis said the agency will consult with the Department of Justice on the questions the organization is raising. Jennifer Kalez, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, said the agency is reviewing Columbia Riverkeeper’s position and expects to respond within the next week. “We will do our due diligence to evaluate how LUBA’s decision may affect the energy facility” she said.Columbia Riverkeeper said it is also looking at other legal avenues to dispute the validity of the air permit.Backers of the project are hoping to open the facility in 2024 and say it would create 3,500 temporary construction jobs, 240 permanent jobs during operation and generate more than $45 million in state and local tax revenue annually.Renewable diesel is a replacement for petroleum-based diesel that is refined from vegetable oil, animal fats, seed oil and waste grease. Backers of the project say the life-cycle greenhouse emissions are 80% lower than petroleum-based fuels. Meanwhile, transportation emissions account for the largest portion of Oregon’s emissions and have been the most difficult sector to achieve reductions in.Community members and conservation groups claim the project would pose a major pollution risk for the Port Westward community as well as those downwind and downstream from the refinery and railyard. They say DEQ’s analysis downplayed those risks.The facility expects to produce 1.6 million gallons a day of fuel at startup and 2.1 million gallons a day at full capacity. It would consume large amounts of natural gas in the process, with associated emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.- Ted Sickinger; tsickinger@oregonian.com; 503-221-8505; @tedsickingerIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",40,"'-221':746 '-8505':747 '1.6':704 '112sharesby':16 '2':32 '2.1':714 '2024':569 '240':580 '3':575 '45':589 '500':576 '503':745 '80':632 'account':642,757 'achiev':659 'activ':398 'ad':287 'advanc':322 'affect':343,535 'agenc':354,481,507 'agricultur':135 'air':150,241,345,390,460,557 'allow':133 'also':545 'amount':726 'analysi':696 'anim':613 'annually.renewable':597 'anoth':235,414 'appeal':110 'appeals.columbia':84 'approv':62,89,162,189,225,282,431 'argu':60,142 'ask':23 'associ':734 'august':164 'author':29,472 'avenu':550 'awar':351 'backer':97,207,620 'base':100,210,605,637 'believ':196,358 'billion':34 'billion-plus':33 'board':82,117,327 'bottom':439 'call':68 'capac':721 'certif':420 'claim':291,666 'clatskanie.columbia':45 'clatskanie.new':15 'columbia':42,57,194,214,288,510 'commiss':320 'commission':86 'communiti':679 'compani':412,456 'compens':769 'conform':272 'conserv':104,363,664 'consist':424 'construct':578 'consult':483 'consum':724 'controversi':51 'counti':85,192,228,285 'creat':574 'cycl':628 'day':708,718 'decis':74,112,147,340,533 'decision.next':263 'deliveri':382 'depart':158,177,486,502 'deq':308,421,475,694 'diesel':7,37,53,598,606 'difficult':656 'dilig':527 'director':310,364 'disingenu':294 'disput':552 'downplay':697 'downstream':686 'downwind':684 'due':526 'either':293 'email':454 'email.he':302 'emiss':403,630,641,650,735 'energi':179,504,537 'environment':160,318 'estuari':59 'evalu':529 'exempt':169 'expect':515,701 'facil':130,155,239,371,538,567,700 'fat':614 'februari':88 'feedstock':384 'feldman':312 'follow':71 'fuel':638,710 'full':720 'gallon':706,716 'gas':729 'gase':738 'generat':586 'grant':168 'greas':619 'greenhous':629,737 'group':105,367,665 'hinrich':201,298 'hope':563 'houston':99,209 'houston-bas':98,208 'impact':258 'in.community':661 'industri':12 'inform':409 'integr':374 'interim':309 'invalid':474 'jennif':496 'job':579,582 'justic':488 'kalez':497 'key':73 'land':80,90,116,136,145,187,223,261,274,338,426,470 'larg':725 'largest':645 'late':121 'lauren':477 'law':276 'leah':311 'legal':549 'life':627 'life-cycl':626 'line':440 'link':245,762 'list':394 'local':108,594 'look':546 'lower':633 'luba':531 'major':415,672 'may':534,767 'meanwhil':639 'meet':330 'member':315,662 'memo':306 'mid':333 'mid-novemb':332 'million':590,705,715 'moreov':404 'natur':728 'near':44 'new':281 'next':101,211,218,520 'novemb':334 'obtain':171,220 'octob':76,122 'oil':612,616 'one':229,759 'open':565 'oper':445,584 'oppos':48 'oregon':24,648 'oregonian/oregonliveconservationists':20 'organ':493 'outsid':14 'park':13 'part':375 'perman':581 'permit':92,152,174,243,391,416,463 'permit.backers':558 'permit.columbia':346 'petroleum':604,636 'petroleum-bas':603,635 'planned.columbia':138 'plus':35 'point':303 'polici':325 'pollut':673,741 'port':10,677 'portion':646 'pose':670 'posit':356,513 'predic':184 'previous':167 'process':732 'produc':703 'product':752 'project':65,95,206,378,561,623,668 'propos':5,39,125,396 'purchas':750 'qualiti':151,161,242,319,419 'question':70,491 'rail':126,232,251,268,370,397,435,448 'railyard':691 'rais':495 'reappli':278 'receiv':459,768 'redesign':266 'reduct':660 'refin':238,609 'refineri':8,38,54,248,387,438,442,689 'regist':754 'regul':25,428 'regular':329 'render':2 'renew':6,36,52,102,212,219,264 'replac':601 'request':407 'requir':379,430 'resid':109 'respond':517 'revenu':596 'review':509 'revok':27 'revoked.michael':200 'risk':674 'risks.the':699 'river':43,58 'riverkeep':46,139,195,215,289,347,511,541 'rule':119 'said':213,254,299,336,348,368,393,422,451,479,505,542 'said.columbia':540 'say':571,624,693 'sector':657 'seed':615 'sent':313 'separ':222 'serr':362,450 'set':326 'sicking':18,743 'simpli':296 'site':49,173,765 'situat':466 'sourc':401 'spokesperson':203,476,499 'startup':712 'state':28,79,115,592 'suppli':388 'tax':595 'ted':17,742 'tedsickingerif':748 'temporari':577 'transport':640 'tsickinger@oregonian.com':744 'two':221 'under':469 'undercut':148 'uninform':297 'use':81,91,146,188,224,262,275,339,427,471 'valid':554 'veget':611 'wast':618 'water':418,462 'week':22,521 'well':681 'westward':11,678 'wirti':478 'within':518 'without':446 'would':429,573,669,723 'wrong':217 'wrong.dan':361 'yard':127,233,252,269,436,449",
"Lawmakers skeptical as Kroger, Albertsons execs say merger will be good for consumers",The Associated Press,Business,,"Nov. 30, 2022, 7:25 a.m.",144,"Kroger CEO William Rodney McMullen speaks during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights hearing on the proposed Kroger-Albertsons grocery store merger, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022.AP Photo/Mariam ZuhaibNEW!144sharesBy The Associated PressU.S. senators from both parties expressed skepticism Tuesday that a proposed merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons would result in lower prices for consumers.“Fewer local options mean less competition to keep prices low,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, in a hearing before the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Padilla said Kroger and Albertsons compete in many California cities.But the CEOs of Kroger and Albertsons insisted there will still be competition, and said a merger will help them counter growing rivals like Walmart, Costco and Amazon.Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said the days of shoppers buying all their groceries at one store once a week are gone. Shoppers often get their groceries at five or six different locations, he said.“I just don’t see less competition going forward,” McMullen said. “It’s easy for customers to take a left turn or a right turn.”Kroger announced its plan to acquire Albertsons for $20 billion in mid-October. Together, the companies would control about 13% of the U.S. grocery market. If it’s approved by U.S. antitrust regulators, the deal is expected to close in early 2024.Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, noted the subcommittee would have little say in whether the merger will go through. That will be a decision for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. But he said the hearing was an important opportunity for the public to understand a merger that could impact their lives.Lee needled Kroger for approving a $1 billion stock buyback last year even as food prices were jumping for consumers. Lee said U.S. households paid an average of $110 more for food in October than they did a year ago.“If Kroger wasn’t passing on savings to consumers when it was competing with Albertsons, then why would we think it would pass on savings after it eliminates competition?” he said.But McMullen said Kroger has lowered prices after other mergers, like its 2013 acquisition of Harris Teeter.“From a business standpoint, that is our commitment,” he said.McMullen reiterated Kroger’s plan to spend $500 million reducing prices, $1.3 billion updating Albertsons stores and $1 billion on higher employee wages and improved benefits if the merger goes through.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, asked about the timeframe for that spending and wondered who would make sure the company met its commitments. McMullen said those investments would be spread over four years.Others peppered the companies with questions about potential store closures or employee layoffs. Kroger and Albertsons have said they will sell or spin off up to 375 Albertsons stores in markets where they currently compete.“The intent is not to close stores. The intent is to divest stores,” Albertsons President and CEO Vivek Sankaran said.But that didn’t ease lawmakers’ concerns. Several noted that when Albertsons acquired Safeway in 2015 for $9.2 billion, the FTC required it to divest 168 stores. The largest buyer of those stores filed for bankruptcy protection nine months later and Albertsons wound up buying back some of the locations.“When divested assets head into bankruptcy in less than a year, that remedy is an embarrassing failure,” Lee said.Sankaran said the FTC approved the buyer in that merger. This time, he said, Albertsons — pending the FTC’s approval — may spin off stores into a separate company that would be led by experienced leaders.Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,800 stores in 35 states, including brands like Ralphs, Smith’s and Harris Teeter. Alberstons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw’s. Together the companies employ around 710,000 people.Federal lawmakers aren’t the only ones scrutinizing the merger plan. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general sued to block Albertsons from paying a $4 billion dividend to its shareholders until they have reviewed the merger.That payout is temporarily on hold after a state judge in Washington said he needed more time to consider the matter.-- The Associated PressIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",47,"'000':651 '1':294,401 '1.3':395 '110':316 '13':212 '144sharesby':40 '168':526 '2':609,630 '20':200 '2013':370 '2015':516 '2022.ap':37 '2024.sen':234 '273':631 '29':36 '34':634 '35':613 '375':473 '4':680 '500':391 '710':650 '800':610 '9.2':518 'account':723 'acquir':197,513 'acquisit':371 'ago':327 'alberston':624 'albertson':25,60,101,112,198,342,398,462,474,495,512,542,583,676 'alex':80 'amazon.kroger':133 'ami':415 'announc':193 'antitrust':15,90,224 'approv':221,292,573,588 'aren':654 'around':649 'ask':420 'asset':553 'associ':42,713 'attorney':671 'averag':314 'back':546 'bankruptci':536,556 'base':604,625 'benefit':409 'billion':201,295,396,402,519,681 'bipartisan':667 'block':675 'bois':627 'brand':616,637 'busi':377 'buy':142,545 'buyback':297 'buyer':530,575 'california':83,105 'capitol':31 'ceo':2,108,134,498 'cincinnati':606 'cities.but':106 'close':231,487 'closur':456 'commiss':263 'commit':382,437 'committe':96 'compani':208,434,450,596,647 'compens':735 'compet':102,340,481 'competit':13,73,118,173,356 'concern':507 'consid':709 'consum':17,67,307,336 'control':210 'costco':131 'could':285 'counter':126 'current':480 'custom':182 'day':139 'deal':227 'decis':258 'democrat':84,419 'depart':267 'didn':503 'differ':163 'divest':493,525,552 'dividend':682 'earli':233 'earlier':663 'eas':505 'easi':180 'elimin':355 'embarrass':566 'employ':648 'employe':405,458 'even':300 'expect':229 'experienc':602 'express':48 'failur':567 'feder':261 'fewer':68 'file':534 'five':160 'food':302,319 'forward':175 'four':446 'ftc':521,572,586 'general':672 'get':156 'giant':57 'go':174,252 'goe':413 'gone':153 'groceri':26,56,145,158,216 'group':668 'grow':127 'harri':373,622 'head':554 'hear':19,87,272 'help':124 'higher':404 'hold':696 'household':311 'idaho':628 'impact':286 'import':275 'improv':408 'includ':615,636 'insist':113 'intent':483,490 'invest':441 'jewel':640 'judg':700 'judiciari':10,95 'jump':305 'justic':266 'keep':75 'klobuchar':416 'kroger':1,24,58,99,110,192,290,329,361,386,460 'kroger-albertson':23 'largest':529 'last':298 'later':540 'lawmak':506,653 'layoff':459 'leaders.kroger':603 'led':600 'lee':236,308,568 'left':186 'less':72,172,558 'like':129,368,617,638 'link':728 'littl':245 'lives.lee':288 'local':69 'locat':164,550 'low':77 'lower':64,363 'make':431 'mani':104 'market':217,477 'matter':711 'may':589,733 'mcmullen':5,136,176,359,438 'mean':71 'merger':28,54,122,250,283,367,412,578,661 'merger.that':691 'met':435 'mid':204 'mid-octob':203 'mike':235 'million':392 'minnesota':418 'month':539,665 'need':705 'needl':289 'nine':538 'note':240,509 'nov':35 'octob':205,321 'often':155 'ohio':607 'one':147,658,725 'oper':608,629 'opportun':276 'option':70 'osco':641 'padilla':81,97 'paid':312 'parti':47 'pass':332,350 'pay':678 'payout':692 'pend':584 'people.federal':652 'pepper':448 'photo/mariam':38 'plan':195,388,662 'polici':14 'potenti':454 'presid':496 'pressif':714 'pressu.s':43 'price':65,76,303,364,394 'product':718 'propos':22,53 'protect':537 'public':279 'purchas':716 'question':452 'ralph':618 'receiv':734 'reduc':393 'regist':720 'regul':225 'reiter':385 'remedi':563 'republican':239 'requir':522 'result':62 'review':689 'right':18,190 'rival':128 'rodney':4,135 'safeway':514,639 'said':78,98,120,137,166,177,270,309,360,439,464,570,582,703 'said.but':358,501 'said.mcmullen':384 'said.sankaran':569 'sankaran':500 'save':334,352 'say':246 'scrutin':659 'see':171 'sell':467 'sen':79 'senat':9,44,94 'separ':595 'sever':508 'sharehold':685 'shaw':643 'shopper':141,154 'site':731 'six':162 'skeptic':49 'smith':619 'speak':6 'spend':390,426 'spin':469,590 'spread':444 'standpoint':378 'state':614,635,670,699 'still':116 'stock':296 'store':27,148,399,455,475,488,494,527,533,592,611,632 'su':673 'subcommitte':11,91,242 'sure':432 'take':184 'teeter':374,623 'temporarili':694 'think':347 'through.sen':414 'time':580,707 'timefram':423 'togeth':206,645 'trade':262 'tuesday':34,50 'turn':187,191 'u.s':215,223,310 'understand':281 'updat':397 'utah':238 'vivek':499 'wage':406 'walmart':130 'washington':33,702 'wasn':330 'week':151 'whether':248 'william':3 'wonder':428 'would':61,209,243,345,349,430,442,598 'wound':543 'year':299,326,561 'years.others':447 'zuhaibnew':39",
Dear Doctor: Are severe reaction to blood thinners used during heart surgery common?,Dr. Keith Roach,Health,,"Nov. 30, 2022, 6:00 a.m.",0,"Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: A good friend of mine experienced what appeared to be a mild heart attack and went to his physician to have it checked out immediately. The tests found acute blockages in the arteries around his heart, and his doctors performed a triple-bypass heart surgery two days later.My friend came through the procedure just fine, but by the second day, he started quickly going downhill as his doctors struggled to find the cause and stabilize him. He died about five days later, and his wife informed me that he had a severe reaction to the blood thinner that they used during his surgery and that they were unable to reverse the effect. His wife told me the name of what this is called, but I am unable to recall it. Is this a common problem, and aren’t they able to pretest for this possibility before surgery? -- C.E.ANSWER: I am very sorry to hear about your friend.This sounds like a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It is not common at all: It is so uncommon that testing for it ahead of surgery isn’t recommended unless the person has a history of low platelets (those are the blood-clotting cells) with current or recent use of heparin (an anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting during surgery) in the past. Even small amounts of heparin can lead to this rare complication, and cardiac surgery normally uses large amounts of heparin.Besides the relative rarity of the diagnosis, the blood tests that could be used to find antibodies to heparin are often negative, even in a person with known or suspected HIT in the past. Yet, they can still get HIT upon re-exposure to heparin. A careful history and review of previous operations is important, but cannot identify everyone at risk for this condition.Even though the platelet counts are low (“thrombocytopenia” means “too few platelets”), the big problem with HIT is abnormal blood clotting. HIT has a mortality rate of about 20%. In order to treat the condition, it first must be recognized, and that means the surgeons need to carefully monitor platelet counts and, if the counts are going down, to look for any evidence of abnormal blood clotting. Treatment needs to begin even before results of laboratory testing becomes available, and that means stopping heparin (which is universally used during cardiac surgery, unless a person has a history of this condition) and beginning a different type of anticoagulant, such as argatroban, immediately. Unfortunately, despite best care, people can still die from this condition.DEAR DR. ROACH: Why is it every time I get my flu shot, I get an outbreak of vaginal herpes? And will taking Valtrex right after the flu shot make the shot not work? -- L.S.ANSWER: Herpes outbreaks, both oral and genital, can be associated with psychological or physical stress. A review of the vaccine adverse event reporting system shows very few reports of genital herpes following influenza vaccine, so this does not seem to be a common issue.Valacyclovir (Valtrex) is an antiviral medicine that works uniquely on herpes viruses. It will not affect the flu shot in any way.Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Dear Annie: I have no contact with my estranged daughter. Should I include her in my will?,Annie Lane,Advice,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 4:00 p.m.",0,"Annie Lane writes the Dear Annie advice column.NEW!By Annie LaneDear Annie: I’m writing to ask your opinion about whether I should include my estranged daughter in my will. She accused me of something very vile that never happened and spread it throughout the family. She also broke her younger sister’s heart for another reason. I have a grandson I’m not allowed to see, and communication with my daughter is nonexistent.I have moved 1,000 miles away to avoid the drama. Since I’m no longer welcome in her life, should I even consider her when I die? -- Devastated in AlabamaDear Devastated: Wills are a bookend to human life and can include sentimental information addressed to cherished loved ones. If the relationship you have with your daughter doesn’t fit that mold, you should not feel obligated to include her in yours. If you’re serious about not including her, though, you should write something specific to that effect so that it’s clear her exclusion isn’t an oversight but an intention.Your daughter sounds troubled, and you were wise to move away. At the same time, try to stay open to the possibility of a reconciliation, perhaps starting with your grandson, if that is even possible. If you can talk to your daughter with love and forgiveness in your heart -- recognizing that she is in pain -- it is always possible that things will unfold so that you will find a totally different answer to the question of your will.Dear Annie: In 2010, I discovered that my husband of 47 years had been in touch with a woman who he had a long and intimate relationship with before we met. She had a child three months before we met and wanted him to marry her, but he refused because he had learned that she was also intimate with someone else at the same time.When I confronted him with the information about this, he lied to me.Long story short, it turned out that he had visited and slept with this woman at least once in the 1970s, after we had three children. He visited her again in 2009 because she had contacted him, and they talked frequently on the phone, allegedly about her concerns about her daughter’s problems. The three of them met for lunch, and he gave the daughter a very large amount of money.For at least two years, I felt like a tidal wave had swept through my life. Of course, we separated, and I had several years of counseling. He had four counseling sessions. But I could never bring myself to get a divorce for several reasons, one being my age.I don’t think the counseling was much help except for someone to talk to about how I was feeling. Ultimately, time heals the wounds, but I still haven’t forgiven, even though we’ve been living together again since 2016. -- BetrayedDear Betrayed: Therapy doesn’t always give us the happy ending that we want. What it does give us are the tools to cope with overwhelming emotions and the skills to articulately communicate in our relationships. Don’t underestimate the value of having someone to talk to about your feelings.Yes, time heals all wounds, but counseling can often expedite the process. Continue to talk through your emotions and evaluate your relationship in therapy. It’s never too late to start a new chapter.Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.COPYRIGHT 2022 CREATORS.COMIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",172,"'000':78 '1':77 '1970s':349 '2009':360 '2010':256 '2016':487 '2022':578 '47':263 'account':588 'accus':32 'address':118 'advic':7 'age.i':447 'alabamadear':104 'alleg':373 'allow':65 'also':48,309 'alway':233,493 'amount':397 'anni':1,6,10,12,254,574 'anoth':56 'answer':247 'articul':519 'ask':17 'avoid':82 'away':80,186 'betray':489 'betrayeddear':488 'bookend':109 'bring':435 'broke':49 'chapter.send':570 'cherish':120 'child':287 'children':354 'clear':167 'column.new':8 'communic':69,520 'compens':600 'concern':376 'confront':319 'consid':97 'contact':364 'continu':549 'cope':511 'could':433 'counsel':425,429,452,543 'cours':416 'creators.comif':579 'daughter':27,72,130,177,217,379,393 'dear':5 'dearannie@creators.com.copyright':577 'devast':102,105 'die':101 'differ':246 'discov':258 'divorc':440 'doesn':131,491 'drama':84 'effect':162 'els':313 'emot':514,554 'end':498 'estrang':26 'evalu':556 'even':96,209,478 'except':456 'exclus':169 'expedit':546 'famili':46 'feel':139,466 'feelings.yes':537 'felt':405 'find':243 'fit':133 'forgiv':221 'forgiven':477 'four':428 'frequent':369 'gave':391 'get':438 'give':494,505 'grandson':61,205 'happen':40 'happi':497 'haven':475 'heal':469,539 'heart':54,224 'help':455 'human':111 'husband':261 'includ':24,115,142,152 'inform':117,323 'intention.your':176 'intim':278,310 'isn':170 'lane':2,575 'lanedear':11 'larg':396 'late':565 'learn':305 'least':345,401 'lie':327 'life':93,112,414 'like':406 'link':593 'live':483 'long':276 'longer':89 'love':121,219 'lunch':388 'm':14,63,87 'marri':297 'may':598 'me.long':329 'met':283,292,386 'mile':79 'mold':135 'money.for':399 'month':289 'move':76,185 'much':454 'never':39,434,563 'new':569 'nonexistent.i':74 'oblig':140 'often':545 'one':122,444,590 'open':194 'opinion':19 'oversight':173 'overwhelm':513 'pain':230 'perhap':201 'phone':372 'possibl':197,210,234 'problem':381 'process':548 'product':583 'purchas':581 'question':250,572 're':148 'reason':57,443 'receiv':599 'recogn':225 'reconcili':200 'refus':301 'regist':585 'relationship':125,279,523,558 'see':67 'sentiment':116 'separ':418 'serious':149 'session':430 'sever':422,442 'short':331 'sinc':85,486 'sister':52 'site':596 'skill':517 'slept':340 'someon':312,458,531 'someth':35,158 'sound':178 'specif':159 'spread':42 'start':202,567 'stay':193 'still':474 'stori':330 'swept':411 'talk':214,368,460,533,551 'therapi':490,560 'thing':236 'think':450 'though':154,479 'three':288,353,383 'throughout':44 'tidal':408 'time':190,468,538 'time.when':317 'togeth':484 'tool':509 'total':245 'touch':268 'tri':191 'troubl':179 'turn':333 'two':402 'ultim':467 'underestim':526 'unfold':238 'us':495,506 'valu':528 've':481 'vile':37 'visit':338,356 'want':294,501 'wave':409 'welcom':90 'whether':21 'will':106 'will.dear':253 'wise':183 'woman':271,343 'wound':471,541 'write':3,15,157 'year':264,403,423 'younger':51",
"New Alzheimer’s drug slows progression slightly, study results show",The Associated Press,Business,"Nov. 30, 2022, 4:44 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 4:31 p.m.",0,"A closeup of a human brain affected by Alzheimer's disease is on display at the Museum of Neuroanatomy at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, N.Y. (AP Photo/David Duprey)APNEW!By The Associated PressAn experimental Alzheimer’s drug modestly slowed the brain disease’s inevitable worsening — but the anxiously awaited new data leaves unclear how much difference that might make in people’s lives.Japanese drugmaker Eisai and its U.S. partner Biogen had announced earlier this fall that the drug lecanemab appeared to work, a badly needed bright spot after repeated disappointments in the quest for better treatments of the incurable disease.Late Tuesday, the companies provided full results of the study of nearly 1,800 people in early stages of the mind-robbing disease. The data was presented at an Alzheimer’s meeting in San Francisco and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Lecanemab delayed patients’ worsening by about five months over the course of the 18-month study, Eisai’s Dr. Michael Irizarry told The Associated Press. Also, lecanemab recipients were 31% less likely to advance to the next stage of the disease during the study.“That translates to more time in earlier stages” when people function better, Irizarry said.Every two weeks, study participants received intravenous lecanemab or a dummy infusion. Researchers tracked them using an 18-point scale that measures cognitive and functional ability.The study’s key finding: Those given lecanemab declined more slowly, a difference of not quite half a point on that scale over the 18 months, concluded the research team led by Dr. Christopher van Dyck at Yale University.Doctors are divided over how much difference that may make for patients and families -- especially as the drug carries some worrying potential safety risks including brain swelling.“It is unlikely that the small difference reported in this trial will be noticeable by individual patients,” said Dr. Madhav Thambisetty of the National Institute on Aging, who noted he wasn’t speaking for the government agency.He said many researchers believe a meaningful improvement would require at least a difference of a full point on that 18-point scale.But Dr. Ron Petersen, an Alzheimer’s expert at the Mayo Clinic, said the drug’s effect was “a modest one but I think it’s clinically meaningful” -- because even a few months’ delay in progression could give someone a little more time when they’re functioning independently.The trial is important because it shows a drug that attacks a sticky protein called amyloid -- considered one of several culprits behind Alzheimer’s -- can delay disease progression, said Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Association.“We all understand that this is not a cure and we’re all trying to really grasp what it means to slow Alzheimer’s, because this is a first,” Carrillo said.But any delay in cognitive decline early on could be meaningful for “how much time we have with our loved ones in a stage of disease where we can still enjoy family and outings, vacations, bucket lists,” she said.Amyloid-targeting drugs can cause side effects that include swelling and bleeding in the brain, and lecanemab did as well. One type of this swelling was seen in about 13% of recipients. Eisai said most were mild or asymptomatic.Also, two deaths have been publicly reported among lecanemab users who also were taking blood-thinning medications for other health problems. Eisai said Tuesday the deaths can’t be attributed to the Alzheimer’s drug.But Mayo’s Petersen said if lecanemab is approved for use in the U.S., he’d avoid prescribing it to people on blood thinners at least initially.And Thambisetty said the death reports raise concern about how the drug may be tolerated outside of research studies “where patients are likely to be sicker and have multiple other medical conditions.”The Food and Drug Administration is considering approving lecanemab under its fast-track program, with a decision expected in early January. If approved, it would be the second anti-amyloid drug on the market.Nearly all treatments available for the 6 million Americans with Alzheimer’s — and millions more worldwide with the most common form of dementia — only temporarily ease symptoms. Scientists don’t yet know exactly how Alzheimer’s forms but one theory is that gunky amyloid buildup plays a key role, although drug after drug that targets it has failed.In a contentious move last year, the FDA approved the first amyloid-targeting drug, Biogen’s Aduhelm, despite lack of evidence of better patient outcomes. Insurers and many doctors have hesitated to prescribe the pricey drug -- another reason experts have anxiously awaited word of how well the newer lecanemab may work.If the FDA approves lecanemab, patients and their families will need a voice in deciding whether it’s worth the hassle of IV infusions and the risk of side effects for the chance of at least some delay in progression, Petersen said.“I don’t think we’re going to stop the disease in its tracks” with just amyloid-targeting drugs, he added, saying it will take a combination of medications that target additional Alzheimer’s culprits.Researchers are preparing to test lecanemab with other experimental drugs, and how it works in high-risk people before they show the first signs of memory problems.______The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Mpox still spreading, Oregon officials warn as cases climb again",Fedor Zarkhin,Health,"Nov. 30, 2022, 4:45 p.m.","Nov. 30, 2022, 4:07 p.m.",0,"Mpox cases are on the rise again in Oregon, with about eight new cases reported per week, on average, since Nov. 9, up from about three reported each week, according to state data. In this photograph, microbiologist Annette Atkinson demonstrates how mpox is tested for at the Utah Public Health Laboratory, Friday, July 29, 2022, in Taylorsville, Utah. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) APAPNEW!By Fedor Zarkhin | The Oregonian/OregonLiveOregon cases of the monkeypox virus, which health officials recently renamed “mpox,” have seen a modest resurgence following a nearly month-long stretch with only a handful of new cases reported each week.State health officials reported 24 new cases of mpox during the three-week period ending Wednesday — three times as many as during the prior three weeks, state data shows. The increase means an October lull in new cases did not spell the end of Oregon’s outbreak, which the state says has so far infected 265 people.While not remotely as contagious as common respiratory viruses like COVID-19 or the flu, mpox can come with excruciatingly painful lesions and other symptoms. It spreads primarily through skin-to-skin contact and, in particular, sex, though people physically caring for an infected person can also get the virus.The medical establishment is following the World Health Organization’s lead in referring to the virus by its new name, mpox, instead of monkeypox, which some health agencies have deemed to be a stigmatizing and potentially racist name.While the mpox virus can theoretically infect any person who has been sufficiently exposed, the outbreak in Oregon and nationally has affected gay, bisexual and queer men most. Only 11 Oregonians who had an infection told officials they are heterosexual and no more than five said they are women, state data show.The outbreak peaked in early August at about 10 to 15 new cases diagnosed each week, the Oregon Health Authority said in a statement Tuesday. Following that peak, new cases fell to about three a week until the week ending Nov. 16, when officials reported 11 new mpox cases, followed by another 13 cases in the two weeks that followed.Now, the Oregon Health Authority and Dr. Tim Menza, the agency’s primary adviser on the its mpox response, are asking Oregonians to take notice.“We must continue our work with community partners on outreach efforts that encourage people to watch for symptoms, get tested and get vaccinated,” Menza said in a written statement. “We must continue to encourage healthcare providers to keep mpox top of mind when evaluating patients with consistent symptoms and to vaccinate patients who may be at greater risk of mpox infection.”About 17,400 doses of the mpox vaccine have been administered statewide, including 6,000 second doses. “Many more” people could get shots, the health authority said, and another 6,000 or so are eligible for a second one.— Fedor ZarkhinIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",201,"'-19':168 '000':454,470 '10':303 '11':273,340 '13':347 '15':305 '16':336 '17':441 '2022':55 '24':104 '265':156 '29':54 '400':442 '6':453,469 '9':22 'accord':30 'account':489 'administ':450 'advis':367 'affect':265 'agenc':234,364 'also':204 'annett':38 'anoth':346,468 'ap':59 'apapnew':62 'ask':374 'atkinson':39 'august':300 'author':314,358,465 'averag':19 'bisexu':267 'bowmer':61 'care':198 'case':2,14,68,97,106,138,307,324,343,348 'come':174 'common':163 'communiti':385 'compens':501 'consist':425 'contact':190 'contagi':161 'continu':381,410 'could':460 'covid':167 'data':33,128,294 'deem':236 'demonstr':40 'diagnos':308 'dose':443,456 'dr':360 'earli':299 'effort':389 'eight':12 'elig':474 'encourag':391,412 'end':115,143,334 'establish':209 'evalu':422 'excruci':176 'expos':257 'far':154 'fedor':64,479 'fell':325 'five':288 'flu':171 'follow':84,211,320,344 'followed.now':354 'friday':52 'gay':266 'get':205,397,400,461 'greater':435 'hand':94 'health':50,74,101,214,233,313,357,464 'healthcar':413 'heterosexu':283 'includ':452 'increas':131 'infect':155,201,250,278,439 'instead':228 'juli':53 'keep':416 'laboratori':51 'lead':217 'lesion':178 'like':166 'link':494 'long':89 'lull':135 'mani':120,457 'may':432,499 'mean':132 'medic':208 'men':270 'menza':362,402 'microbiologist':37 'mind':420 'modest':82 'monkeypox':71,230 'month':88 'month-long':87 'mpox':1,42,78,108,172,227,246,342,371,417,438,446 'must':380,409 'name':226 'name.while':244 'nation':263 'near':86 'new':13,96,105,137,225,306,323,341 'notic':378 'nov':21,335 'octob':134 'offici':75,102,280,338 'one':478,491 'oregon':9,145,261,312,356 'oregonian':274,375 'oregonian/oregonliveoregon':67 'organ':215 'outbreak':147,259,296 'outreach':388 'pain':177 'particular':193 'partner':386 'patient':423,430 'peak':297,322 'peopl':196,392,459 'people.while':157 'per':16 'period':114 'person':202,252 'photo/rick':60 'photograph':36 'physic':197 'potenti':242 'primari':366 'primarili':184 'prior':124 'product':484 'provid':414 'public':49 'purchas':482 'queer':269 'racist':243 'receiv':500 'recent':76 'refer':219 'regist':486 'remot':159 'renam':77 'report':15,27,98,103,339 'respiratori':164 'respons':372 'resurg':83 'rise':6 'risk':436 'said':289,315,403,466 'say':151 'second':455,477 'seen':80 'sex':194 'shot':462 'show':129 'show.the':295 'sinc':20 'site':497 'skin':187,189 'skin-to-skin':186 'spell':141 'spread':183 'state':32,127,150,293 'statement':318,407 'statewid':451 'stigmat':240 'stretch':90 'suffici':256 'symptom':181,396,426 'take':377 'taylorsvill':57 'test':44,398 'theoret':249 'though':195 'three':26,112,117,125,328 'three-week':111 'tim':361 'time':118 'told':279 'top':418 'tuesday':319 'two':351 'utah':48,58 'vaccin':401,429,447 'virus':72,165,222,247 'virus.the':207 'watch':394 'wednesday':116 'week':17,29,113,126,310,330,333,352 'week.state':100 'women':292 'work':383 'world':213 'written':406 'zarkhin':65 'zarkhinif':480","{""The Oregonian""}"

Portland’s Jefferson High will preserve historic 1909 building in upcoming modernization,Julia Silverman,Education,,"Dec. 02, 2022, 1:03 p.m.",120,"Portland Public Schools board members will vote on a plan to modernize Jefferson High School, but preserve the school's historic 1909 core building.Photo by Eder Campuzano/StaffNEW!120sharesBy Julia Silverman | The Oregonian/OregonLiveFor two years, students, parents, educators and neighbors have mulled plans to renovate North Portland’s Jefferson High School, which serves the state’s highest concentration of Black high schoolers.Now, the final proposal for the extensive renovations, slated to begin in 2024, is coming into focus – but how much money it will cost is still a big question mark, especially given Portland Public Schools’ history of higher-than-predicted final costs on some previous school modernization projects.On Dec. 13, the school board will vote on a recommendation to completely renovate Jefferson’s existing building, which was built in 1909.A full teardown and rebuild had also been under consideration for the high school, à la the brand new Lincoln High School in Southwest Portland, which opened this fall at a cost of about $245 million, nearly $60 million more than the original estimate.But community feedback ran strongly in favor of preserving the historic building, a team from Bora and Lever, the architecture firms working on the project, told a school board subcommittee on operations and facilities earlier this week. The building has remained a landmark in the Black community even as the neighborhood around the school has gentrified, pricing out many Black families who have moved east of 82nd Avenue, said Chandra Robinson, an architect with Lever.“There’s been a recognition that the neighborhood has changed, it will continue to change. But the fact is that the overall form of the original 1909 building and the placement of buildings on the campus is what people understand to be part of the community,” Robinson said. “It was important for community members to be able to save something they had a memory of, and pass that to future generations and imagine people coming back to the neighborhood.”Enrollment in the district has been declining among elementary and middle schoolers, including those who would attend the newly completed Jefferson in 2028. That’s a trend driven by declining birth rates and rising home prices that began prior to COVID-19. That drop was then exacerbated by the pandemic, when some families moved, went to private school or started home-schooling during the district’s yearlong building closure. PPS lost about 4,200 students between fall 2019 and fall 2021, enough to fill three large high schools.When it reopens in 2028, Jefferson would have more than 200,000 square feet of usable space, which Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero noted this week will be “the most available square footage of any of our comprehensive high schools, [with] at least of today, the smallest enrollment.”The new Jefferson will have space for 1,700 students, the same as the district’s seven comprehensive high schools. But Jefferson is a magnet school that features a college-going culture and partnership with neighboring Portland Community College; students attend it only by choice, not by neighborhood assignment. Students who live in the surrounding neighborhoods are offered the chance to enroll at either Jefferson or one of three other high schools: McDaniel, Grant or Roosevelt, Currently, only about 600 are enrolled at Jefferson.Prior to its reopening, the board and district have suggested that there will be a reconsideration of those dual assignment enrollment boundaries. And they have also said they plan to reserve spots at the school for the children of Jefferson’s strong contingent of Black and other alumni, even those who no longer live in the district. That’s similar to an attendance-via-petition program available at Boise-Eliot elementary school, another school with deep ties to the Black community that sits in a gentrifying neighborhood.Jefferson will be the seventh of the district’s high schools to undergo renovations or a rebuild when construction begins in 2024. It’s expected to open in fall 2028, and students will remain onsite during the construction period. Cleveland High School, in Southeast Portland, and Ida B. Wells, in Southwest Portland, are the remaining schools that have yet to be refurbished.Plans call for a handful of new spaces, including a central courtyard, new gym facilities, a media center, and a performing arts wing, with a new theater and multiple dance studios. The school is home to the Jefferson Dancers, an elite troupe that draws students from across the city. The school’s well-loved blue track oval, a touchstone for neighbors, some of whom helped fundraise for its original construction, will remain intact.Construction costs for Jefferson will be covered by the district’s $1.2 billion bond, approved by voters in 2020, when the cost of the project then was estimated at $311 million. But the actual cost will be higher, given a huge jump in inflation-related construction costs over the last two years, Bora and LEVER architects say. The 2020 bond included $93 million set aside for potential cost escalation, which district officials say they can tap for Jefferson . The project’s architects say they will unveil an updated cost estimate when the full school board meets in mid-December.Meanwhile, plans to relocate Harriet Tubman Middle School, another school with historic ties to Portland’s Black community, remain up in the air. The school is currently located adjacent to Interstate 5, raising serious health concerns over air quality and in 2021, the Legislature set aside $120 million for a new middle school at a location yet to be determined.There had been talk of relocating Tubman to the Jefferson campus, but that’s essentially off the table now because of space constraints, according to school board member Julia Brim Edwards. One potential option is to co-locate it with Kairos charter school, which also serves a predominately Black student body and operates in the former Humboldt Elementary School, whose front door is a quarter-mile walk from Jefferson.That building has room for 510 students, an independent building assessment conducted in 2020 concluded, so it might need to be expanded to accommodate Kellogg. Kairos currently enrolls 247 students, while Kellogg has 361.District leaders say they hope to have landed on a firm location for Tubman by April and have it open by 2027, if all goes well. In the meantime, Tubman students would attend a so-called “swing site” school, potentially in the former Kenton Elementary School, which is four miles from the Tubman campus.—Julia Silverman,

"Portland’s plan to curb Central Eastside crime, homelessness replicates Old Town’s. Will it work?",Catalina Gaitán,Portland,"Dec. 02, 2022, 2:29 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 6:46 p.m.",177,"Rapid Response crews clean up an encampment on May 11, 2022 located near NW Broadway and NW Flanders Street.NEW!177sharesBy Catalina Gaitán | The Oregonian/OregonLive.comAnother coalition of Portland business and neighborhood leaders has persuaded Mayor Ted Wheeler to order coordinated sweeps of homeless encampments in an effort to curb crime and visible homelessness, this time in the Central Eastside Industrial District.The strategy — a “90-day reset” — is modeled after one the mayor adopted in Old Town this spring. Whether it worked there depends on whom you ask.Wheeler made the latest pledge on Tuesday to the Central Eastside Industrial District — a mix of 1,400 commercial, professional and industrial businesses on 622 acres along the Willamette River, mostly in Southeast Portland — in response to safety concerns highlighted by Salt & Straw’s announcement last week that it may move its headquarters.Jessie Burke, who chairs the Old Town Community Association and owns the Society Hotel on Northwest Third Avenue, said the strategy was successful there. She authored the reset plan after Wheeler declared a homelessness state of emergency in February, calling on the city to reduce the number of tents in Old Town by 33%.The plan also sought additional outdoor lighting in the area, 60 inches of sidewalk clearance in the neighborhood and the removal of garbage with the help of Downtown Portland Clean & Safe, among other strategies to increase cleanliness, public safety and accessibility in the neighborhood.Even though the 90 days ended in June, the plan is still guiding work in the neighborhood, Burke said, and conditions have improved. “In general, it’s going much better,” Burke said.By the end of April, the city had removed 137 tents from Old Town, a 300% increase from that time in 2021. An additional 206 were removed in May, a 450% increase from that time last year, according to city data.Since the program ended, Burke said the number of tents on Old Town sidewalks is down to about 70 from 400. A Clean & Safe truck cleans the neighborhood seven days a week, and workers say they often make three trips per day to the dump with litter they’ve collected.“The 90 days didn’t really matter – it wasn’t the timeline, it was more a work plan for all of us,” she said. “And to quote Teddy Roosevelt, ‘Complaining without a suggestion is just whining.’”During a press conference in June about the strategy, police Chief Chuck Lovell said the city’s response in Old Town led to reported drug offenses dropping by half, a 93% decrease in trespassing reports and a 13% decrease in vandalism between March 22 and May 20, compared with the prior 60-day period.Serious problems remain. In September, two people died in stabbings in 24 hours in Old Town, highlighting the fragile condition of the district. And in October, parking patrol agents with the city said they avoided solo trips to Old Town due to safety concerns.Advocates for the homeless say sweeps in the industrial district will further traumatize the population.Scott Kerman, executive director of Blanchet House, which offers free meals and other services in Old Town, called the sweeps “tornados,” which saw unsheltered people returning to discover their homes gone and their neighborhood destroyed.Since the sweeps in Old Town, Kerman said more people have been coming into Blanchet House experiencing heightened anxiety and mental health issues. They have also been in greater need of clothing, blankets and sleeping bags as theirs have been taken.Those left behind were often those with the highest need in terms of mental illness, substance abuse and chronic homelessness – all of which “ratcheted up tension” in the neighborhood, he said.“We devalue the kind of community people form in these encampments,” Kerman said. “We only really hear about the violence and we focus on things like trash, but there’s honest community and friendship and support that exists within these houseless communities and encampments, and sweeps can really destroy that.”While Burke agreed the sweeps could be traumatic, she said allowing people to camp on downtown streets and sidewalks was less humane.“City infrastructure never intended for humans to live on the sidewalk,” she said. “Rats are chewing through people’s tents while they’re sleeping.”Before a 90-day reset goes into effect in the Central Eastside, Kerman said he hoped city leaders would reach out to Blanchet House and other agencies like Street Roots, Portland Rescue Mission and Central City Concern to do “proactive problem solving” and identify some unintended consequences that may arise from the reset.“We may not all agree on the plans being offered, but I do understand there’s a lot of relief that at least there are some plans on the table,” Kerman said. “And what I would rather do is find ways to work with our partners to improve these things than to simply throw stones at it.”Prior to the sweeps in Old Town, the city reached out to people with available shelter spots and free transportation to the shelters. But Kerman said many unhoused people are “shelter-resistant” because they have had traumatic experiences at a shelter and don’t feel safe there.Only 18 people living inside the estimated 164 tents that were removed took the city up on the offers, Cody Bowman, a spokesman in Wheeler’s office, said in May.While the full scope of the new “reset” isn’t yet clear, Wheeler indicated that removing encampments would be one of its pillars. Wheeler also said he planned to address gun violence in the area by recruiting and retaining more police officers.Also on Tuesday, Portland City Council approved $27 million in funding that will build three 250-person, city-operated camping sites and other initiatives to reduce street camping.The mayor plans to meet again with Central Eastside business leaders on Friday. He has not said when the plan would begin.-- Catalina Gaitán, cgaitan@oregonian.com, @catalingaitan_Our journalism needs your support.

"Oregon Measure 114 draws third legal suit, latest from NRA, National Shooting Sports Foundation",Maxine Bernstein,Public Safety,"Dec. 01, 2022, 11:37 p.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 3:26 p.m.",647,"The latest suit blasts the state for trying to impose a new permit application process to buy a gun before the details for an application process are in place and amid lingering questions regarding what agencies will accept applications and what funding and staffing is needed to support the program.AFP via Getty ImagesNEW!647sharesBy Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe National Rifle Association’s Oregon affiliate, joined by two former state lawmakers, an Oregon sporting goods store and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Thursday filed the third lawsuit challenging Measure 114, a day before a judge hears arguments on whether to delay the gun control measure from taking effect.The suit contends the measure imposes “severe and unprecedented burdens” on people seeking to lawfully acquire a gun under the Second Amendment and bans what it says have become standard magazines of ammunition.The measure, narrowly passed by 50.7% of voters, is set to take effect next Thursday. It will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that contain more than 10 rounds, require a permit to buy a gun and prevent any gun sale or transfer before a criminal background check is completed.The latest suit blasts the state for trying to impose a new permit application process to buy a gun before all the details for an application process are in place and amid lingering questions about what agencies will accept the applications and what funding and staffing are needed to support the program.It also echoes the prior lawsuits, which argue the measure violates the right to due process and the Second Amendment right to bear arms.“One might think that a state bent on imposing such a novel and burdensome permitting regime would at least take the time to make sure it had the infrastructure and resources in place to ensure that it would operate as smoothly as possible,” attorney Shawn M. Lindsay wrote on behalf of the plaintiffs.Lindsay, a Lake Oswego-based lawyer, filed the new lawsuit, but he’s expected to have help from two of the lawyers responsible for the major gun rights victory in June before the U.S. Supreme Court that set a new legal standard for evaluating Second Amendment claims. Attorneys Paul D. Clement, a former U.S. Solicitor General, and Erin E. Murphy, will be applying to practice in Oregon’s district court, the new suit says. They argued the case before the nation’s high court, which in a 6-3 ruling struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home.In a statement Thursday, Aoibheann Cline, the NRA’s Oregon director, said Measure 114 is “nothing more than an attempt to stifle - if not outright prevent - the purchase of firearms throughout Oregon.”“Forget that it is scheduled to go into effect before Oregon even certifies the election, but it requires potential gun owners to take a class that has yet to be created, at a cost yet to be determined, so that they can obtain a permit that doesn’t actually give them permission to purchase a firearm,” Cline said.Oregon’s attorney general has defended the measure and will be in court Friday morning to urge U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut to deny the Oregon Firearms Foundation’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.The firearms federation was the first to file a legal challenge last week. On Wednesday, the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation followed with its own suit. All the lawsuits are anticipated to be assigned to Immergut.Joining the NRA affiliate, the Oregon State Shooting Association, in this latest suit are Mazama Sporting Goods in Eugene, former state Rep. Katerina B. Eyre, R-Hillsboro, former state Rep. Tim Freeman, R-Roseburg, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.If no permit process is in place by next Thursday, they contend gun sales will cease on that day.Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall has argued in court papers that any delay in the new regulations would result in more deaths and deter the state from trying “to reduce the risk of a massacre” in Oregon.The Oregon Department of Justice has said it is working with state police to assist the agency in drafting rules for the new regulations and permit-to-purchase process. State police Capt. Kyle Kennedy said Thursday afternoon that the state police will provide information related to Measure 114 “as pieces are finalized.” The state police are finalizing an application form for permits and evaluating its future staffing needs, Kennedy said.The new regulations are designed to reduce mass shootings, suicides and homicides, the proponents have said. In 2020, 593 Oregonians died by gunfire, according to the attorney general’s office.Marshall quoted from a study by Alexander D. McCourt, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who found that permit-to-purchase gun laws, coupled with comprehensive background check requirements “were consistently associated with” lower firearm homicide and suicide rates.The new regulations also won’t harm gun owners, Marshall argued in court papers. People who already own magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds can retain them in their homes and still use them as long as they do so on their property or for sport shooting, shooting competitions or hunting, within state law, he noted.If the regulations are delayed, more people will continue to rush out and buy more guns and magazines, Marshall argued.After a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against California’s ban on large-capacity magazines in March 2019, he cited reports that large-capacity magazines poured into California’s gun stores. A judge later allowed the California ban to take effect, and the following week, a 19-year-old man bought a rifle and several 10-round gun magazines from a San Diego gun store. On April 27, 2019, the 19-year-old entered a Chabad synagogue in Poway, Calif., wearing a tactical vest that held five 10-round magazines and his rifle loaded with another 10-round magazine. He fired all 10 rounds of the loaded rifle magazine, killing one congregant and injuring three others, according to news reports cited by Marshall in his filing.“Before the gunman could reload with one of his five other magazines , an unarmed congregant rushed at him, forcing him to retreat to his car,” Marshall wrote, adding that gave time for an armed off-duty officer to intervene and fire back. The gunman then fled by car and surrendered.Gun rights advocates, including the plaintiffs in the latest suit, counter that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are standard today, and the measure would turn “law-abiding citizens into criminals” by making it a misdemeanor crime to carry or use the larger-capacity magazines outside of a shooting range, private property or for competition or hunting.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

"Nike won’t face class action in gender discrimination lawsuit, judge rules",Jeff Manning,Business,"Dec. 02, 2022, 2:10 p.m.","Nov. 29, 2022, 6:47 p.m.",0,"Nike could not be reached for comment on the ruling.Nike photoNEW!By Jeff Manning | The Oregonian/OregonLiveNike scored an important victory in a sex discrimination case filed by a group of female employees and former employees when the judge declined to certify the women’s case as a class-action.U.S. District Court Judge Magistrate Jolie Russo ruled that the plaintiffs “fail to provide sufficient evidence of a company policy or practice that both uniformly applies and harmed the entire putative class of 5,200 female employees.”In a case marked by secrecy and sealed documents, even Russo’s ruling was kept under wraps for eight days before it was unsealed Tuesday.The ruling essentially shrinks the pool of plaintiffs from 5,200 to the 14 who wanted to serve as class representatives.The plaintiffs claimed that the 5,200 women employees at Nike who are members of the class were paid, on average, $11,000 a year less than their male counterparts.Nike’s attorneys argued that the plaintiff’s expert witnesses were wrong and that it discriminated against no one.The question of whether it was Nike policy to base new employees’ compensation on their pay at their former job became central to the argument. And on that front, Russo ruled the plaintiff’s argument was unconvincing, Russo ruled.“Certainly, plaintiffs have shown that, in the aggregate, there is a statistically significant disparity among pay for women compared to pay for men at Nike,” Russo ruled. “Plaintiffs have not, however, provided a statistical analysis demonstrating on a class-wide basis that starting pay is lower for women and higher for men where prior pay was a data point used by hiring managers in determining starting pay.”Class-action lawsuits are potent courtroom tools as they allow a handful of plaintiffs to essentially represent a much larger group. They are also controversial as critics have argued they can be more profitable for lawyers than for plaintiffs.Laura Salerno Owens, a lead attorney for the employees and former employees, said her side will object to Russo’s ruling. Because Russo is a magistrate judge rather than a full federal judge, the plaintiffs can file an objection and have the same class certification battle heard by Marco Hernandez, the chief U.S. District Court judge in the District of Oregon.Nike could not be reached for comment.The decision comes four years after the case was filed, when Nike was gripped by corporate in-fighting and allegations of sexual misconduct and bullying. At the same time, a group of influential women on Nike’s campus began protesting what they perceived as a gender gap on Nike’s campus when it came to compensation and opportunity.Nike’s defense was complicated by the fact that in 2018, senior Nike executives vowed to address issues of gender equity within the company.After four years of work, much of that time consumed by a marathon discovery process that Russo called “rancorous,” Nike grudgingly gave up corporate data. Nike insisted on a protective order that sealed what it considered potentially sensitive corporate information.The Oregonian/OregonLive and other media outlets joined the case in order to protest the secrecy.Russo unsealed some of those documents at the same time she ruled on the class certification. One of those freshly unsealed documents is Salerno Owens’ argument in favor of class certification.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.",48,"'000':154 '11':153 '14':125 '200':85,122,138 '2018':459 '5':84,121,137 'account':564 'action':50,288 'address':465 'aggreg':225 'alleg':411 'allow':296 'also':310 'among':232 'analysi':252 'appli':76 'argu':164,315 'argument':203,213,550 'attorney':163,330 'averag':152 'base':188 'basi':259 'battl':370 'becam':199 'began':430 'bulli':416 'call':489 'came':445 'campus':429,442 'case':25,45,90,398,519 'central':200 'certain':218 'certif':369,540 'certifi':41 'certification.if':555 'chief':376 'claim':134 'class':49,82,131,148,257,287,368,539,554 'class-act':48,286 'class-wid':256 'come':393 'comment':7 'comment.the':391 'compani':69 'company.after':472 'compar':236 'compens':191,447,576 'complic':453 'consid':507 'consum':481 'controversi':311 'corpor':406,495,510 'could':2,386 'counterparts.nike':161 'court':53,379 'courtroom':292 'critic':313 'data':276,496 'day':107 'decis':392 'declin':39 'defens':451 'demonstr':253 'determin':283 'discoveri':485 'discrimin':24,176 'dispar':231 'district':52,378,383 'document':96,530,546 'eight':106 'employe':32,35,87,140,190,333,336 'entir':80 'equiti':469 'essenti':114,302 'even':97 'evid':66 'execut':462 'expert':169 'fact':456 'fail':62 'favor':552 'feder':356 'femal':31,86 'fight':409 'file':26,361,400 'former':34,197,335 'four':394,473 'fresh':544 'front':207 'full':355 'gap':438 'gave':493 'gender':437,468 'grip':404 'group':29,307,422 'grudg':492 'hand':298 'harm':78 'heard':371 'hernandez':374 'higher':268 'hire':280 'howev':248 'import':19 'in-fight':407 'influenti':424 'information.the':511 'insist':498 'issu':466 'jeff':13 'job':198 'join':517 'joli':56 'judg':38,54,351,357,380 'kept':102 'larger':306 'lawsuit':289 'lawyer':322 'lead':329 'less':157 'link':569 'lower':264 'magistr':55,350 'male':160 'man':14 'manag':281 'marathon':484 'marco':373 'mark':91 'may':574 'media':515 'member':145 'men':240,270 'misconduct':414 'much':305,477 'new':189 'nike':1,142,185,242,402,427,440,461,491,497 'object':341,363 'one':541,566 'one.the':179 'opportunity.nike':449 'order':502,521 'oregon.nike':385 'oregonian/oregonlive':512 'oregonian/oregonlivenike':16 'outlet':516 'owen':327,549 'paid':150 'pay':194,233,238,262,273,285 'perceiv':434 'photonew':11 'plaintiff':61,119,133,167,211,219,245,300,359 'plaintiffs.laura':325 'point':277 'polici':70,186 'pool':117 'potent':291 'potenti':508 'practic':72 'prior':272 'process':486 'product':559 'profit':320 'protect':501 'protest':431,523 'provid':64,249 'purchas':557 'putat':81 'question':180 'rancor':490 'rather':352 'reach':5,389 'receiv':575 'regist':561 'repres':303 'representatives.the':132 'rule':58,100,113,209,217,244,345,536 'ruling.nike':10 'russo':57,98,208,216,243,343,347,488 'said':337 'salerno':326,548 'score':17 'seal':95,504 'secreci':93 'secrecy.russo':525 'senior':460 'sensit':509 'serv':129 'sex':23 'sexual':413 'shown':221 'shrink':115 'side':339 'signific':230 'site':572 'start':261,284 'statist':229,251 'suffici':65 'time':420,480,534 'tool':293 'tuesday.the':112 'u.s':51,377 'unconvinc':215 'uniform':75 'unseal':111,526,545 'use':278 'victori':20 'vow':463 'want':127 'whether':182 'wide':258 'wit':170 'within':470 'women':43,139,235,266,425 'work':476 'wrap':104 'wrong':172 'year':156,395,474","{""The Oregonian""}"

So, maybe they will be gassed a bit. Then again, heavy minutes were logged by most key players in a game the Jazz led 101-81 at the end of the third quarter.Regardless of Utah’s energy levels, the Blazers are dealing with gutting injury issues. Josh Hart (ankle) is doubtful. Drew Eubanks (right hip contusion) is questionable. Nassir Little is now out for six weeks with a right hip fracture. Plus, Lillard (right calf), Keon Johnson (left hip pointer) and Gary Payton II (return to competition reconditioning) remain out.That’s potentially six players out against a Jazz team that can fill it up and the Blazers defense hasn’t exactly been good as of late.The Jazz won 118-113 at Portland on Nov. 19, the night Lillard injured his right calf for the second time this season.The Blazers have lost five out of six since. The Jazz lost five consecutive games after winning at Portland but have won their last two.The Jazz rank fifth in offensive rating (116.9) while the Blazers have dropped to 24th in defensive rating (115.3).Should Hart join Little in street clothes, the Blazers would be down two significant defenders making slowing down Utah’s offense quite unlikely.A loss would send the Blazers below .500 for the first time this season.PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS AT UTAH JAZZWhat: Trail Blazers (11-11) at Jazz (14-11), 6 p.m., Saturday.Where: Vivint Arena, Salt Lake City, Utah.Radio: Rip City Radio (KPOJ 620 AM).TV channel: Root Sports Plus (in Portland: Comcast 1253, DirecTV 687-1).Watch the game live online: You can watch this game live for FREE with fuboTV (free trial).

Reed College professor to resign eight months after video of racist rant,Sami Edge,Education,"Dec. 02, 2022, 10:45 a.m.","Dec. 01, 2022, 4:10 p.m.",0,"A sign on the Reed College campus advertises a sit-in at the administration building to support immigrant students and decry the college's response to tenured professor Paul Currie's rant about ""illegal immigrants.""NEW!By Sami Edge | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThis story was updated on Dec. 2 to include comment from Reed College professor Paul Currie.Paul Currie, a tenured psychology professor at Reed College, will resign from his post eight months after a video captured him going on a racist rant against local restaurant employees.Currie, who has apologized for what he called “reprehensible” behavior, said this week that he doesn’t remember the incident and was under the influence of insomnia medication.Currie was on sabbatical in March when a video of him interacting with workers at what looks like a fast food drive-through window prompted campus protests. In the video, Currie says something about “hiring illegal immigrants” and questioning whether an unidentified employee was born in the United States.Currie issued a written apology to the Reed community afterward. Students, frustrated with what they considered a lackluster response from Reed’s administration, staged campus protests demanding the college take steps to address bias and discrimination. Some called for Currie to be fired. In a letter to campus on Wednesday, Reed president Audrey Bilger said a faculty committee investigated the incident and “found no violation of college policy.” However, Bilger said after reviewing the report she spoke with legal experts and Currie, who subsequently resigned from his position, effective January 6.“Since coming to Reed, my priority has been and remains to support students in their educational pursuits, efforts that rely on an inclusive and welcoming campus environment,” Bilger wrote in her letter.Currie penned his own letter to campus, which he shared with The Oregonian/OregonLive on Friday.“I’ve been living with intense shame and regret from an event I - still to this day - do not remember,” Currie wrote. “There is no excuse to ever engage in offensive or discriminatory behavior and I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Currie wrote that the video “depicts complex sleep behavior caused by a medication prescribed by my physician.” Currie told the faculty investigative committee about his history with acute insomnia, and he wrote he believes that’s why the committee found that Reed had no cause to fire him or impose any penalties.Currie defended what he called his decades-long “commitment to students’ diversity and inclusivity,” in the classroom and research laboratory.Referring to diversity, equity and inclusion, he wrote, “My final hope is that we appreciate how DEI contributes to the overall character and openness of the Reed College community.” Paul Currie Statement[49] by sami edge on ScribdThis story was brought to you through a partnership between The Oregonian/OregonLive and Report for America. Learn how to support this crucial work.Sami Edge covers higher education for The Oregonian.

They were outshot for the game, were outplayed in the 2nd period, and needed two early power play goals in the 3rd period to get in front. Still, progress after a poor week.They go back up I-5 for the third time in ten days against an Everett team that they beat a week ago last Wednesday, 5-2, in a game where both teams were a lot less healthy than they will be in this one.Forwards2011-Robbie Fromm-Delorme (216 games)1992-Jack O’Brien (163)

They’ve gotten healthier. Jackson Berezowski returned after missing 6 games; against Kelowna and Spokane he had a goal and 4 assists. Defenseman Aidan Sutter returned after missing 5, and had 2 points against Spokane. Those were their two big injuries, although they still have a lot of depth sitting out.Their schedule will test them in the run-up to Christmas. They have 8 games and 5 of them are against Portland and Seattle. They’re 6 points behind Seattle and 11 behind Portland, so this is their chance to make up ground.Forwards2017-Jackson Berezowski (238)

Here’s what we know about the investigation and what happened that weekend.What happened on that weekend?Shortly before noon Pacific time on Sunday, Nov. 13, Moscow police officers responded to a 911 call about an unconscious person in a house near the U of I campus. They walked in to find four dead bodies. Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt reported that they had been stabbed to death with a large, fixed-blade knife in the early morning hours.The coroner’s report did not include times of death, but Moscow Mayor Art Bettge previously told the Idaho Statesman that the students were killed between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. that Sunday.Autopsies confirmed that all four died from multiple stab wounds and that all were likely asleep when the attacks started. Some victims showed defensive wounds. None of the victims showed signs of sexual assault, the coroner said.Who were the victims?The four were University of Idaho seniors Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum; junior Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls; and freshman Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington.The three women — Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves — lived at the King Road home with at least two other roommates, both of whom survived.Chapin was staying the night with Kernodle, whom he was dating.This is the off-campus residence where four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in their beds.TNSWhere did the 911 call come from?The two surviving roommates had been out that night but were not together. Police have said both were home by about 1 a.m. on Sunday and would have been in the house at the time of the attack.They were unharmed and did not wake up until late Sunday morning, according to police. Both had bedrooms on the first floor. The victims were found on the second and third floors — two on each floor. Police would not specify which victims were where.Police revealed that the 911 call was made from inside the house on one of the surviving roommates’ cellphones. The surviving roommates summoned friends to the house because they believed one of the victims on the second floor had passed out and was not waking up. Multiple people there talked with the 911 dispatcher before officers arrived, the Moscow Police Department said.Where did it happen?The homicides happened in Moscow, situated along the Idaho-Washington state line, about 30 miles north of Lewiston and 85 miles south of Coeur d’Alene. It’s home to the University of Idaho.Moscow has a population of about 25,850, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and U of I reports an enrollment of 11,507 students. The city is just a 9-mile drive from Pullman, Washington, which is home to the larger Washington State University.The six-bedroom house where the students were living was just off campus in the 1100 block of King Road.What do we know about the shelter-in-place order the day of the killings?U of I told people to “stay away from the area and shelter in place” at 2:07 p.m. Pacific time on Nov. 13 as the police department investigated a homicide. Nearly 90 minutes later, the university tweeted that the shelter in place order was lifted, but called for Moscow residents to “remain vigilant.”According to the U of I website, a shelter-in-place order can be issued by the University Office of Public Safety and Security in response to a hazardous spill, hostile intruder or weather emergency. An order is sent out using the Vandal Alert system. It requires students, faculty and visitors to take refuge in an interior room with no or few windows.Boise State University students and others pay their respects at a vigil for the University of Idaho students who were killed.TNSDo we know why this happened?Police have given little information about a possible motive for the killings, but law enforcement have repeatedly said they believe it to be a “targeted attack.” They have declined to give further information about what led to that belief.“To be honest, you’re going to have to trust us on that at this point because we’re not going to release why we think that,” Moscow Police Capt. Roger Lanier said last week.At another news conference, Fry declined to say whether the attack was carried out by a single person or multiple people, and could not say whether one of the roommates was explicitly targeted.What were the victims doing before the attack?Kernodle and Chapin had been at a party at the Sigma Chi fraternity house — less than a mile from the house on King Road — and returned home at about 1:45 a.m. Sunday.Goncalves and Mogen had spent the evening at the Corner Club bar before stopping at a downtown food truck on the way home. They used a “private party” to ride home from the food truck, police said last week. Both girls also arrived home at around 1:45 a.m.Multiple calls were made from Goncalves’ and Mogen’s cellphones between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. to a male who did not answer. A sister of Goncalves, Alivea, said the calls were made to an individual named Jack who is a friend. Alivea said her sister was known for frequently making late-night phone calls.Have police cleared anyone?Detectives have said they do not believe that the two surviving roommates or any individuals summoned to the household on Sunday morning were involved in the crime.The police also cleared a male singled out in surveillance footage of the Grub Truck food truck, the “private party” driver who took Goncalves and Mogen home early that morning, and the individual called by Goncalves and Mogen.The Latah County Sheriff’s Office and Moscow police have addressed numerous rumors and questions surrounding the homicides. This includes a reported incident involving a dog attacked with a knife elsewhere in Moscow that the sheriff’s office said was unrelated.Moscow police also said Saturday that the Moscow stabbings are not tied to a a 1999 double stabbing in Pullman, Washington, as well as a 2021 double stabbing in Salem, Oregon. On Nov. 23, Lainier also acknowledged that police had been unable to validate reports that Goncalves had a stalker — information that came out in interviews — but said the department would continue to seek information regarding it.In an email release Monday, police said a February 2022 death in Moscow is not related to the quadruple homicide investigation. Police said the Latah County Coroner’s Office ruled that death to be from an overdose.Police also said reports that a red Mustang on S. Deakin Street was being processed as part of the murder investigation were not true and that the vehicle “is not connected to this incident.”What is the school doing?U of I President Scott Green told students in a memo ahead of Thanksgiving break that the school would “remain flexible” through the end of the semester. University faculty have been asked to prepare both in-person and remote learning options so students who do not wish to return to Moscow until the spring semester can finish their fall courses online.Drop-in counseling for students through the Counseling and Testing Center will remain throughout the week of Nov. 28. Students can also make an appointment at (208) 885-6716. The phone line provides 24-hour-a-day access to counselors.The university’s Safe Walk program will be available throughout the rest of the semester. The service allows students, faculty and guests to call (208) 885-7233 and have a campus security officer meet them anywhere on campus and walk them to their destination.A candlelight vigil planned for U of I’s campus on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Pacific time has been moved indoors to the Kibbie Dome because of strong wind forecasts, the school said in a release Monday night. The U of I Boise campus, U of I Idaho Falls, Idaho State University and College of Eastern Idaho will all hold simultaneous vigils on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Mountain time.--Sally Krutzig and Shaun

Readers respond: Time for homelessness action from Oregon leaders,Letters to the editor,Opinion,,"Dec. 01, 2022, 7:00 a.m.",0,"NEW!By Letters to the editor | The OregonianThe Nov. 20 editorial on Mayor Ted Wheeler’s strategy for homelessness falls short with its final sentence, “It’s time leaders listen as well,” (“Editorial: A homelessness strategy for our current reality,”). Hundreds of millions of dollars have been budgeted and spent by city, counties, Metro and Salem. Leaders have opined, proclaimed, declared, promised and planned all the while, yet tent camps and trash proliferate and grow.

"Record number of firs dying in Oregon, Washington in what experts call ‘Firmageddon’",Nathan Gilles,Environment,,"Nov. 25, 2022, 12:07 p.m.",553,"Fir trees across Oregon are dying from a combination of drought,  insects and fungal diseases.Ardeshir Tabrizian/The Oregonian (file)NEW!553sharesBy Nathan Gilles | Columbia InsightFir trees in Oregon and Washington died in record-breaking numbers in 2022, according to as-yet unpublished research conducted by the U.S. Forest Service.Called “Firmageddon” by researchers, the “significant and disturbing” mortality event is the largest die-off ever recorded for fir trees in the two states.In total, the Forest Service observed fir die-offs occurring on more than 1.23 million acres (over 1,900 square miles) in Oregon and Washington.Oregon, however, was the hardest hit. The Forest Service observed dead firs on roughly 1.1 million acres (over 1,700 square miles) of forest in Oregon alone. This year’s numbers for the state are nearly double the acres recorded during previous die-offs.Heavily affected areas include the Fremont, Winema, Ochoco and Malheur National Forests.The most southerly of the forests, the Fremont National Forest, was the hardest hit, according to survey data.“We’re calling it ‘Firmageddon,’” Daniel DePinte, who led the survey for the USFS Pacific Northwest Region Aerial Survey, told a gathering of colleagues in October. “It is unprecedented, the number of acres we have seen impacted. It’s definitely significant and it’s disturbing.”Fatal factorsIn an interview with Columbia Insight, DePinte says although his team’s results are preliminary and further analysis is needed, the 2022 Firmageddon appears to be due to a combination of drought coupled with insects and fungal diseases working together to weaken and kill trees.Extreme heat, including last year’s record-breaking “heat dome,” is also being investigated as a possible cause.“When a drought event comes around it basically weakens the entire forest to a point where the insects and the diseases start to work in tandem and this pushes a tree over the edge and it succumbs to mortality,” says DePinte.What’s noteworthy about Firmageddon isn’t just the total area impacted. It’s the number of dead trees within that space.In some areas as much as 50% or more of fir trees are estimated to have died.These “severe” die-off’s occurred in central Oregon in forests running from the Oregon/California border northward, according to survey data.Survey methodSurveys of forests were conducted using a combination of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, drones and satellite imagery.The surveys were primarily conducted, as they have been for decades, using an airplane flying 1,000 feet over forested land.DePinte and his team surveyed forests on federal, state and private lands, adding up to a total of roughly 69 million acres (over 100,000 square miles) in Oregon and Washington.Small sections of California and Idaho, where national forests spill over the state borders, were also surveyed.The Oregon Department of Forestry and Washington Department of Natural Resources also participated in the effort.Although fir die-offs have been recorded as far back as 1952, when surveys began, this year’s Firmageddon dwarfs all previous records.The USFS did not conduct aerial surveys in 2020 due to social-distancing rules around Covid-19.Which fir species impacted?Firmageddon, as the researchers define it, appears to be limited to so-called “true fir” trees; trees in the genus Abies.The Pacific Northwest’s leading timber crop, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), is not in the genus Abies and is not considered to be a true fir.Die-offs were recorded for grand fir, white fir, red fir, noble fir and the hybrid Shasta red fir.The largest mortality was observed at lower elevations where grand fir and white fir are plentiful.White fir was the hardest hit species, according to survey data.Doug fir die-offAlthough true firs are experiencing their worst die-off on record, Douglas fir is having a die-off of its own, though on a comparatively smaller scale.The USFS survey estimates that 450,000 acres (over 700 square miles) of Douglas fir have experienced some level of mortality in Oregon with the majority of this occurring in southwestern Oregon.Washington is also seeing a die-off of Douglas fir with roughly 230,000 acres (nearly 360 square miles) impacted.The level of Douglas fir die-off within the areas affected isn’t considered “severe.” The USFS defines “severe” as 50% or more of the trees within an area having died.However, the extent of the die-off in terms of total area is concerning, according to DePinte.“It [the Douglas fir die-off] is on the lighter side,” says DePinte. “The problem is the extent. When you’re up in a plane flying over and you see that it goes on for the entire mountain side, then it’s like, ‘Whoa! That’s a huge amount of dead trees.’”What’s really unusual, according to DePinte, is the insects that are believed to be causing the Douglas fir die-off are considered to be “secondary agendas.”The insects have the ability to kill trees that are already weakened by drought or extreme heat events, but generally can’t kill the trees on their own.“They can kill trees, but they’re not ‘tree killers,’” says DePinte.The USFS will continue monitoring the Douglas fir die-off and will meet with researchers at Oregon State University in the coming weeks to study the issue further.Although more analysis is required, drought appears to be weakening Douglas fir trees, making them susceptible to insect and possibly also fungal attack.This also appears to be the mechanism affecting true firs.Insects, fungi compound problems“I think it’s sort of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ kind of thing,” says Robbie Flowers, a USFS etymologist, about the likely cause of the fir die-off.Firmageddon has not one cause but multiple compounding causes, according to Flowers.Flowers, who conducted on-the-ground surveys of tree mortality to, in effect, “ground truth” the aerial survey data, says a clear relationship between drought and fir die-offs has been observed historically—droughts tend to lead to fir die-offs.When drought occurs, says Flowers, fir trees become susceptible to pests.The pests implicated in Firmageddon are the fir engraver beetle (Scolytus ventralis), a type of bark beetle; and multiple fungal root diseases.Various parasitic fungi can make fir roots less able to absorb water. This makes the trees more susceptible to drought conditions.Firs with root disease are also more susceptible to insect attacks, especially from the fir engraver beetle, which gets its name because it burrows and carves up the water-rich cambium layer of a tree just under the bark.The fir tree’s only defense against this attack in its cambium layer is to flush the insects out with pitch. But if drought and root diseases make water less available, the trees can’t amount a defense.As a consequence, says Flowers, a large enough fir engraver infestation can effectively “girdle” an already water-stressed fir tree.“The trees have a limited amount of resources they can put into defense and they’re defenses go down then they get into these stressful situations,” says Flowers.Drought’s fingerprintThat drought is very likely weakening fir trees and making them susceptible to infections isn’t surprising.According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Oregon and Washington have been in some form of drought since the early 2000s.The recent dieback of western red cedars has also been linked to drought by area researchers. (A dieback occurs when a tree or other plant begins to die from the tip of its leaves or roots inward. Unlike die-offs, which count dead trees, diebacks count dead, dying and sick trees.)While observed on redcedars experiencing dieback, biotic factors like insects and fungi were estimated by researchers to be secondary to drought as the leading cause of tree illness and death.The spread of fir die-off and the spread of drought in Oregon match closely.In fact, DePinte notes, those areas of Oregon that have been especially hard hit with “extreme” and “exceptional drought” (as defined by the Drought Monitor) are the same areas where his team observed the largest die-offs of firs.Increased risk of wildfireUnsurprisingly, having more than half the fir trees dead in some of these forests poses a major fire risk.A dangerous fire period can occur within the first two years following a major die-off, says DePinte.During these critical first two years, dead trees continue to hold onto their dried-out needles in the canopy of the forest.This makes severe crown fires far more likely should a fire start.When this happens fire can jump from treetop to treetop, leading to large scale destruction.“It [wildfire] can just go from tree to tree, not even touching the ground hardly, and just burn the entire canopy,” says DePinte. “That is the worst fire there is. It’s the most dangerous and hardest to control.”Nathan Gilles is a freelance science writer based in Vancouver, Washington.##Columbia Insight, based in Hood River, Oregon, is nonprofit news site

Southern California's gigantic water supplier has taken the unprecedented step of requiring some 6 million people to cut their outdoor watering to one day a week as drought continues to plague the state. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard, File)APNEW!By Tribune Content AgencyDrought, human-caused climate change, invasive species and a “legacy” of environmental issues are permanently altering California’s landscape and placing some communities and ecosystems at increasing risk, a panel of experts told water officials recently.Invasive species and decades of disruptions from massive land and water developments are partly responsible for a continuous decline in native California species, experts told the California Water Commission on Nov. 16. Also, rural communities, many of whom are lower income and rely on privately owned wells, are disproportionately contending with water contamination and scarcity amid recurring cycles of drought, experts said.Although droughts in California date back to prehistoric times, the state’s modern-day water issues are the repercussions of decades of decisions, said Jay Lund, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis.“A lot of our environmental problems today are really legacies,” he said. We are witnessing “the dynamics of past impacts and past changes playing themselves out and our inability — both in terms of regulatory policy and economically, and practically in some cases with some invasive species — to manage that playing out of legacy impacts.”Groundwater and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta are also among the sectors most vulnerable to dry periods, according to Lund, who emphasized that although cities and agriculture are relatively prepared and well-insulated from drought impacts, irrigated agriculture needs to shrink between half a million to 2 million acres to be sustainable.About 5.5 million of California’s nearly 40 million residents live in rural counties, which comprise more than half of the state’s land mass. While urban areas like Los Angeles are under mandatory drought restrictions to reduce strain on state reservoirs, many rural residents reliant on groundwater wells are waterless. Compounding the issue is water affordability and a lack of safe drinking water, particularly in the Central Valley and Central Coast.“We know that these challenges disproportionately impact low-income and Latino communities,” said Justine Massey, policy manager and attorney for the Community Water Center. “People relying on private wells in particular are significantly impacted because often they don’t know if their water is safe to drink since there’s no other entity doing water testing, and they’re also not aware until they start experiencing issues with pumping that they may be nearing water levels that will render their well not working.”While state legislation like the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act are meant to regulate water availability and will help mitigate water scarcity in an increasingly arid California, thousands of people and delicate ecosystems will fall through the cracks.A 2020 study commissioned by the Water Foundation found that under SGMA’s minimum water threshold plans, between 4,000 and 12,000 wells will partially or completely dry out by 2040 just in the San Joaquin Valley — affecting roughly 46,000 to 127,000 Californians who may lose access to their current water supply.“We really urge all decision-makers involved … to look at the worst-case scenarios and really plan for that, because that’s what we’re experiencing so far — worst case after worst case after worst case,” Massey said. “And the folks who are most impacted are the ones who least contributed to the problem.”Climate change is increasingly being recognized as a “threat multiplier” that will accelerate and aggravate instability and insecurity around the world. In a drought-stricken California, as groundwater levels drop because of less rain and over pumping, concentrations of contaminants in water increase, Massey said.The current and future health of California’s ecosystems is also on the line.Mild, short-term impacts of drought can result in reduced plant growth, but when dry periods are longer and harsher and groundwater depletion is more severe, widespread mortality of habitats and species can occur, said Melissa M. Rohde, principal of Rohde Environmental Consulting, LLC.“If groundwater demand is high, groundwater can quickly become out of reach from plant roots and rivers because these ecosystems rely on shallow groundwater,” she said.Rhode referenced the Nature Conservancy’s Shallow Groundwater Estimation Tool, which found that 44% of ecosystems statewide have been impacted by a significant, long-term decline in groundwater between 1985 and 2019. “We also found that groundwater levels declines have intensified during the most recent two decades,” she said.Under SGMA, 87% of ecosystems and 40% of wells dependent on groundwater exist outside of the legislation, Rhode said, and “one of the biggest disconcerting aspects of this is that ... these ecosystems are often times the last refugia for federal and state threatened and endangered species. They’re very important biological hotspots, and if we’re not doing what we can to protect them under SGMA, we are not safeguarding our most vulnerable species.”Drought conditions and extreme heat fueled by climate change have also pushed the Chinook salmon to the brink of extinction.The fish — which once swam upstream the Sacramento River to spawn in its chilly waters before the Shasta Dam’s completion in 1945 — has struggled to survive even with government intervention. Last year, the water flowing from Shasta Dam was so warm that most of the eggs and young salmon died.Wildfires, drought and bark beetle infestations are also destroying the forests of the southern Sierra Nevada, which could have dire consequences for protected species like spotted owls and Pacific fishers that depend on mature tree canopies for their habitats.But refusing to accept these changes is pointless, Lund said. “Resistance is futile. We’re going to have a future that’s going to be different,” and learning to reconcile our ecosystems with human activity will be an ongoing challenge. “How do you manage your native species when everything else is changing is going to be a big conundrum for all of our agencies and all the people trying to do this,” he said.So what can we do about it? For ecosystems, integrating them into water policies, identifying ecological oases and managing groundwater to ensure species have access to it during droughts will be critical, Rhode said.As for rural communities, Lund suggested we look at how and why urban and agricultural spaces have responded more effectively to drought: their missions are focused; they have reliable funding sources; they have organized authority and expertise; and they have accountability via voters, regulators and ratepayers.“The state has the responsibility to make sure that drinking water needs are protected and not waved away as a cost of business or set aside as something that’s too difficult or inconvenient to address,” Massey said.“Climate change is testing and surpassing our limits and our normal flexibility,” she added. “The margin of error becomes tighter and tighter. That margin of error is already extremely thin, and what’s on the line is Californians’ access to a life-giving resource.”— Dorany Pineda©2022 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.
