Pacific University removes name of racist former Oregonian editor from campus building,|By Rob Davis || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:23 p.m.|,None,|Pacific University's board of trustees voted to remove the name of Harvey W. Scott from this building on the school's Forest Grove Campus. Scott, the university's first graduate, was editor of the Morning Oregonian almost continuously from 1865 to 1910, a time in which he opposed giving women and Black people the right to vote.NEW!By Rob Davis || The Oregonian/OregonLivePacific University’s board of trustees this weekend voted to remove Harvey Scott’s name from one of its campus buildings, citing The Oregonian/OregonLive’s recent series that spotlighted its former editor’s racist legacy.“Pacific acknowledges historical ties with and past recognition of a community leader who advanced racism in our state, and we apologize for the harm it has caused,” university President Jenny Coyle said in a Monday letter to employees and current students. “We are committed to examining and learning from our past.”Scott, the first graduate of Pacific University, edited the Morning Oregonian almost continuously from 1865 until his death in 1910, and held a minority ownership interest in the paper published by Henry Pittock. Under Scott, the newspaper excused lynching, promoted Jim Crow segregation, opposed equal rights for women and people of color, celebrated laws to exclude Asian immigrants and described Native Americans as uncivilized, saying their extermination might be needed.Pacific University, a private school in Forest Grove with almost 4,000 students, had worked in recent years “to rethink and reframe how we acknowledge his legacy in relation to our university,” Coyle said. But Scott’s name remained on a building that housed the university’s Center for Gender Equity and Multicultural Student Center, and an eight-foot-tall portrait of him hung in the university’s library.“As the first baccalaureate graduate, a donor and supporter of the university, and a notable and influential figure in Oregon history, he received considerable attention. Celebrating a person due to their influence alone is wrong when that influence is used to cause harm,” Coyle said in the statement.“And, as is clear from The Oregonian’s recent reporting, his influence caused significant oppression and harm,” she added.Coyle said the building, which opened in 1967 and is scheduled to be renovated this spring, will temporarily be renamed Pacific Hall while the university decides on a permanent name. Scott’s portrait has been removed from display, a university spokesperson said.Scott remains the namesake of two other local schools: Scott Elementary School in Portland and Mount Scott Elementary School in the North Clackamas School District. Officials in each district did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether they plan to reevaluate the names.— Rob Davis rdavis@oregonian.com 503.294.7657; @robwdavisSubscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Roommates of Idaho stabbing victims break silence,By Tribune Content Agency,Nation/World,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:21 p.m.|,None,|FILE - Officers investigate the deaths of four University of Idaho students at an apartment complex south of campus on Nov. 14, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP, File)APNEW!By Tribune Content AgencyThe surviving roommates in last month’s fatal, unsolved University of Idaho stabbings expressed devastation over the murders as they broke their silence with a pair of letters.The letters by Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke were read Friday at a memorial service for the four victims that wasn’t open to the media, the Idaho Statesman reported Saturday.“I wish every day that I could give them all one last hug and say how much I loved them,” Funke wrote in her letter, which was read by a pastor at Real Life Ministries in Post Falls, Idaho.Police say Mortensen and Funke aren’t considered suspects in the Nov. 13 attack at their off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho, that left students Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle dead.The victims, who were all in their early 20s, each likely suffered multiple stab wounds while sleeping, an autopsy determined. Authorities haven’t named a suspect, revealed a motive or recovered the murder weapon.“They changed the way I look at life,” Mortensen wrote in his letter. “I know it’ll be hard to not have the four of them in our lives, but I know Xana, Ethan, Maddie and Kaylee would want us to live life and be happy. They would want us to celebrate their lives.”It’s unclear if Mortensen or Funke attended the memorial service in person.Moscow Police have repeatedly urged the public not to believe rumors about the case amid a lack of answers, saying in an update Friday, “Online reports of the victims being tied and gagged are not accurate.”“We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants,” police said.Police previously said they haven’t been able to verify tips that Goncalves spoke about having a stalker.Goncalves called her boyfriend seven times in under 30 minutes on the morning of the murders between around 2:30 to 3 a.m., and Mogen called him three times in that span, Goncalves’ sister says. The killings are believed to have occurred between 3 to 4 a.m.“At 2:26 a.m., Kaylee starts to call Jack,” Alivea Goncalves told Inside Edition. “Kaylee calls Jack six times between 2:26 a.m. and 2:44 a.m. From 2:44 to 2:52 Maddie calls Jack three times, then Kaylee makes a final call to him at 2:52 a.m.”Last month, police said “a male whom Madison and Kaylee had called several times” isn’t considered a suspect.______— by Peter Sblendorio New York Daily News (TNS)©2022 New York Daily News.

Kenny & Zuke’s to close flagship deli in downtown Portland,|By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Dining Out,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:10 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 11:59 a.m.|,None,|Kenny & Zuke's Delicatessen in downtown Portland. Stephanie Yao Long/Staff LC- The OregonianLC- The OregonianNEW!By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLiveAfter 15 years in downtown Portland, Kenny & Zuke’s is closing its flagship deli beneath the Ace Hotel and heading across the river to open a new bagel shop in North Portland.Thought of for many years as the quintessential Jewish deli of the Northwest, Kenny & Zuke’s once boasted several Portland locations, an airport kiosk and a robust wholesale business. It survived both a 2019 bankruptcy and the 2020 pandemic by streamlining its menu toward bagels and bagel sandwiches.That trend will continue with a more “bagel-centric” menu at Kenny & Zuke’s new home on North Williams Avenue, according to owner Ken Gordon. The “more intimate” location, found in the former Kimura Toast Bar (and, before that, Ristretto Roasters) space, will have espresso drinks, bagels (including par-baked bagels to take home), local smoked lox, pastrami lox and sablefish from downtown’s upcoming Jacob & Sons, as well as Kenny & Zuke’s own whitefish spread.(Neighbors might recall that Gordon previously ran a satellite shop, Kenny & Zuke’s Deli Bar, just a stone’s throw away from the new one.)The downtown deli closure marks the latest change for a prominent block that previously lost Clyde Common, another restaurant once considered among the city’s best.Kenny & Zuke’s flagship deli will remain open until Sunday, December 18. The new Kenny & Zuke’s Bagelworks location will open at 3808 N. Williams Ave., #125 from Tuesdays through Sundays starting on January 1.Read more: Clyde Common has closed, ending a go-go era for Portland dining— Michael Russell; mrussell@oregonian.comOur journalism needs your support.

Pastificio d’Oro is your favorite pasta cook’s favorite pasta restaurant,|By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Dining Out,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:52 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:04 a.m.|,None,|37Pastificio d’OroNEW!By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLiveEditor’s note: This week and next, we’re counting down our favorite new Portland restaurants of 2022, starting with our No. 10: Pastificio d’Oro, a pint-sized St Johns neighborhood pasta restaurant where almost everything is made from scratch.Casting back to summer, some of my fondest memories involve sitting with friends on the wobbly picnic tables outside this St. Johns pasta spot, the sun’s last rays disappearing behind The Wishing Well’s neon palm tree just down the street.At the time, Pastificio d’Oro was still a promising pop-up at Gracie’s Apizza. On Mondays and Tuesdays, former Jacqueline chef Chase Dopson would make pasta entirely by hand while painter Maggie Irwin took orders, poured wine and tossed farm-fresh salads with her signature honey-sweet dressing.The restaurant, which took over the pizzeria space full time last month, remains a true Mom-and-Pop, only one where, according to Dopson, everything but the bread, wine, Parm and charcuterie are made from scratch.“Yeah, but I do slice that,” Irwin points out.Along with Gracie’s, it’s also the latest restaurant bringing a little heat to St. Johns, a North Portland neighborhood where the dive bars might be better known than the restaurants.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com || Instagram || YouTube || Facebook || Twitter || TikTokBut what makes Pastificio d’Oro unique is Dopson’s commitment to making his pasta entirely by hand. That means mixing up balls of golden dough by hand, then rolling each into a billowing sheet using a mattarello, or long wooden rolling pin. It’s a time-intensive method more familiar to Italian nonnas than typical American restaurants, where even the fresh pasta is typically flattened by machine.Dopson started making pasta after he was laid off at the start of the pandemic, reading cookbooks, watching videos and buying an imported mattarello from Evan Funke, the pasta evangelist whose new Los Angeles restaurant Mother Wolf is almost as hard to get into as Portland’s Kann. Like many chefs, he was drawn to the pastas of the Emilia-Romagna region.“It’s so diverse for such a small region, but it’s also so luxurious,” Dopson says. “It’s rustic but rich, gluttonous but so fun to eat. Think of a lasagna Bolognese: It’s so over the top but just so delicious.”After initially launching a meal kit service at Jacqueline, Dopson’s pasta caught the eye of Craig Melillo, the owner of Gracie’s Apizza, where Irwin had previously worked. In 2021, Melillo reached out to the couple about using the pizzeria on Monday nights, when he was typically closed. The first Pastificio d’Oro’s pop-up took place that September.As The Oregonian/OregonLive first reported, Gracie’s Apizza is in the process of moving to a new location with room for a larger oven just a few blocks east. With construction underway, the two businesses have switched roles: Pastificio d’Oro now operates on weekend nights, Gracie’s Apizza pops up on some Mondays and Tuesdays.Visit from Thursday to Sunday now, and you’ll find Dopson’s pastas — some squash-stuffed tortelli, perhaps, or a tagliatelle al ragu — bowls of that zippy salad and plates of aged prosciutto. A rustic tart or sugar-dusted cake rounds out a menu kept blessedly small.Like Funke, Dopson sometimes cooks his pastas a few seconds short of al dente, a level of doneness some will prefer more than others. (The late Los Angeles Times critic Jonathan Gold found Funke’s style distracting enough to leave his blockbuster Santa Monica restaurant, Felix, off his last restaurant guide; I also like a more supple texture, but didn’t find it disqualifying here or at Felix.)And the pleasures of Pastificio d’Oro go beyond pasta. There’s a small wine list, plus good Negronis and other cocktails courtesy of The Garrison, the bar next door. You might find platters of puffy Italian frybread served with a pear-plum mostarda. And though the sun dips below the horizon before Pastificio d’Oro opens these days, it remains a fantastic place to meet friends for dinner, perhaps followed by a movie at the St. Johns Twin across the street.What to order: With a group of two or more, it would be borderline irresponsible not to order the whole menu.Details: After launching as a Monday pop-up, Pastificio d’Oro switched to Thursday-Sunday dinner hours in November; 8737 N.

|For this Oregon actor and vocal coach, music is much more than sound|,|By Tom Hallman Jr. || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Life & Culture,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:30 a.m.|,None,|9Tiara HerrNEW!By Tom Hallman Jr. || The Oregonian/OregonLiveOver a cup of coffee, Tiara Herr rolls up her sleeves to reveal two tattoos. One features five flowers representing the number of times cancer nearly killed her. The other tattoo – 14188 – is her hospital patient number.Given what she’s experienced in life – “I have lived with a dark cloud” -- it would be natural to expect that Herr would be most at ease in the shadows. Instead, she loves being on center stage in front of an audience.To describe what she does with her artistic gift diminishes what she has accomplished, ignoring the obstacles. To focus only on her struggles, though, diminishes what Herr shares with audiences and fellow performers.Is Herr a good singer and vocal coach? Or is she a good singer and vocal coach for someone who has experienced profound hearing loss?“I’ve come to realize that damn near everyone I meet seems to believe that the ability to sing or play music well is a quality that simply cannot be possessed by individuals who are hard-of-hearing or deaf,” said Herr, who was drawn to the theater and performing while a student at Banks High School.“When I was in my 20s,” she said, “a director told me no one would ever hire me because the audience would be unable to understand what I was saying because of what he called my deaf accent.”Herr, 30, grew up in Timber, a small town in unincorporated Washington County. After graduating from high school, she went to Pacific University in Forest Grove, where she earned bachelor’s degrees in music and biology.Now, she is a research assistant at The Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, part of Oregon Health & Science University. Herr works with a team in Beaverton studying viral disease threats using multiple lasers to analyze and characterize the immunological make-up of every cell in a sample stained with fluorescent antibodies.She also plays piano, sings, acts, directs and serves as a vocal coach with Theatre in the Grove, a community theater in Forest Grove.When Tiara was a high school junior, her older sister, Trinity, learned the theater was holding auditions for a musical. The sisters, a cousin and friends all tried out and were cast.“Tiara can hear musical things I don’t hear that need fixing,” said Ken Centers, who has called on Herr as a vocal director for past productions he’s directed. “But then, when we’re talking, there are moments when she says she can’t hear me.”Herr reads lips and occasionally uses hearing aids but has not found a pair that helps with her form of hearing loss. She does not use them when she sings, acts or works with other singers.Herr is currently involved in the Dec. 2-18 production of “World War II Radio Christmas” by Portland playwright Pat Kruis Tellinghusen. The play is set in 1940s Portland and features songs and stories inspired by the experiences of real veterans. Herr is not only in the cast of three women, five men and three children, but she also wrote the music for the commercial jingles used in the production.Herr said she learned how to sing by focusing on how her tongue felt in her mouth rather than by hearing and repeating notes and phrases.“I don’t really understand it,” said Centers. “The best thing I can say is that she’s an enigma.”***Tiara Herr claps to thank her family and friends for support at Pacific University's undergraduate commencement ceremony May 17, 2014.Laura Frazier/The Oregonian/2014Part of the mystery is why Herr is even alive. When she was 13 months old, surgeons removed a cancerous tumor from the adrenal gland on top of a kidney. Months later, Herr’s mother felt more lumps. Herr returned to the Portland hospital. Surgeons removed the cancerous tumors, and the girl was given a good prognosis, her mother said.“When she was 3, she started complaining,” said her mother, Donna Herr. “She said her fishbones hurt, and she pointed to her ribs.”Another trip to the hospital revealed a large cancerous tumor had attached to her liver, displacing the little girl’s pancreas and spleen. The tumor was removed. The doctor suspected more cancerous nodules on her leg and told Herr’s mother the child had high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops throughout the body in nerve cells.“We were told she had a 20% chance of survival,” said Donna Herr. “We called St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis because they specialize in childhood cancer.”The Herrs were told they’d have to pay their way to St. Jude’s. If, after an exam, Tiara was accepted as a patient, the hospital would pick up all future medical and travel costs. They didn’t have the money to make the initial trip. St. Jude’s officials eventually called Donna Herr to say that parents of a St. Jude’s child who had died of neuroblastoma learned of Tiara’s situation and offered to pay for airline tickets and lodging to bring the Oregon girl to the hospital.“I truly believe there was a higher power at work,” said Donna Herr. “When we got there, they did all their tests and found Tiara had a tumor at the bottom of her spine. We were told that when she started treatment, she was going to lose some or all her hearing because of the extensive and intensive chemotherapy.”Donna Herr said drugs needed to fight that form of cancer destroyed her daughter’s inner eardrums, causing her to lose nearly all her hearing within six months.For the next eight years, Tiara Herr traveled to St. Jude’s for treatments. By the end of the journey, surgeons had removed 40 tumors. She underwent a bone marrow transplant, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and intense radiation treatments. Though she could no longer hear the way she had in the past, she never lost her love of music.“While I was sick with cancer and going through a plethora of treatments, my mother and father would encourage me to sing to help me get through,” she said. “This led to me singing at the top of my little lungs while skipping through the hospital in my frilly Easter dresses when I was feeling better. I truly believe that my family fostered a talent I was born with and never let me think for one second that I couldn’t sing just because I was hard of hearing.”***Tattoos on Tiara Herr’s forearm feature five flowers representing the number of times cancer nearly killed her, and the number 14188, her hospital patient number.Jamie Hale/The OregonianTiara Herr learned to love music from her father, George Andrew Herr, who died in 2012 from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.“He sang each morning,” she said. “That’s how he woke us up. He was a lovely tenor. On the way to school, we listened to music in the car, and he sang along with Barry Manilow.”Despite her hearing loss, Tiara taught her herself how to play the family piano and sing. Herr said she hears what she calls “the shape” of a sound. Because she had perfect hearing until she was 6, she said she can remember chords, notes and musical phrases.“I have profound bilateral hearing loss referred to as sensorineural hearing loss,” said Herr. “I can hear almost normal at low pitches, but as the frequency increases, my ability to hear drops off to literally nothing. I am about 90% deaf. I cannot hear fire alarms or birds singing, the latter of which makes me incredibly sad as people say the singing of birds is so beautiful.”In college, Herr studied voice and piano, was in a choir and joined singers from Pacific University who performed in Taiwan.“I think I was born into a family that always had music playing and were singing to me,” said Herr. “But part of it has always been this mysterious thing. Once I lost the biggest section of my hearing, it’s like my other senses magically found a way to make it possible for me to sing and play along with everyone else.”When pressed to explain “mystery,” Herr turns to music theory and history.“I can even recognize pitches that I can’t hear by feeling the vibration and transposing it down to an octave I can hear in my head,” she said. “I got the idea from Beethoven, actually. As he lost his hearing, he started to lay his head on the piano to be able to identify and ‘hear’ his compositions using his sense of touch, sight, and musical intuition. This is basically what I do.”Herr brings that experience and background to Theatre in the Grove.“She’s an inspiration to everyone she works with,” said Jennifer Grimes, who performs in Theatre in the Grove productions, including last summer’s “Mamma Mia.” “She does it with grace and optimism and confidence you wouldn’t expect if you knew her story.”Grimes said watching Herr work as vocal director of “Mamma Mia” was “phenomenal.”“There were 40 of us, and she could tell who was singing the right notes, who needed work,” said Grimes. “She worked out all the harmonies. I don’t know how she does it.”Earlier this year, Herr returned to St. Jude’s to participate in a study on the long-term effects of cancer and treatment on children. She took her hearing aids to help researchers evaluate her.“I played the grand piano in the cafeteria every single day,” she said. “I was surprised how many children noticed that I was wearing the same hearing aids and hospital bracelet as them and were shocked that I could sing and play. I really hope that I can be a role model for children everywhere and let them know that they not only can beat their cancer, but also grow up to be a musician even if they wear hearing aids.”Herr does not believe that music must be reduced to notes and chords written on a page.“Music is so much more than sound,” she said. “Music is emotion. Music is intuitive. Music is natural. Everything is musical and resides in the souls of us all.”— Tom Hallman Jr. 503-221-8224; thallman@oregonian.com; @thallmanjrThis article is supported by PacificSource, a partner of Here is Oregon.

|Take a cozy, car-free family mini-vacation to Cannon Beach|,|By Lizzy Acker || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Travel & Outdoors,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 8:41 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|Nona and her grandparents and Haystack Rock.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianNEW!By Lizzy Acker || The Oregonian/OregonLiveConsider the TikTok travel influencer, jetting to Europe and Asia, having glamorous adventures on sleeper buses and speed trains, backpacks at the ready, vistas everywhere.Now, consider this: You can pack a bag and walk out your door, today even, and have your own glamorous transit-filled adventure in a dreamy location, no plane required.Cannon Beach is an adorable oceanside village, adjacent to what is arguably Oregon’s biggest Instagram star: Haystack Rock. And a very nice bus will take you there, from Portland, Beaverton and Hillsboro, twice a day.On a recent late fall day, I left my house before dawn with a backpack and a three-year-old in a collapsable stroller, and we set off on our sweet little journey.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com || Instagram || YouTube || Facebook || Twitter || TikTokFirst: Trimet.Riding on public transit is one of the true benefits of living in a city. In Portland and the surrounding area, for $2.50, you can travel pretty much anywhere. Is it perfect? No. Is it an amazing resource that is available to everyone? Yes.So, we walked (or strolled, depending) to our nearest bus stop. Because it was a Sunday, and, with a three-year-old, you have to give yourself a little padding if you want to be on time anywhere, we were 23 minutes early, which meant we walked a few stops and watched the sunrise.I am sure someone, somewhere will say that the time constraints presented by transit make it impossible to do with kids, but, counterpoint, those constraints add to the fun – a trip on transit has parameters, which narrow down the possibilities and forces you to make choices and a plan before you go. There’s no getting on the road late, with kids screaming from car seats, feeling stressed and harried. You just … leave early to make sure you are on time. No stress. And kids, almost across the board, love a bus.Nona on Trimet.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianAt least, my kid, Nona, loves a bus. She was happy to climb on and ride downtown, and even happier when her grandparents (my parents) got on some stops later.You could do this trip with one adult per child, but I find the vacations are more fun when the ratio of adults to kids increases. Also, my parents are experts at public transit and I like hanging out with them.Together, the four of us disembarked from the city bus downtown and then walked through Old Town to Union Station. Again, we were a little early, but that meant extra time to walk around the train station and get hot beverages for the adults.The NorthWest route on the Point bus goes from Portland to Astoria with five stops along the coast. The bus itself is a nice coach, with comfy seats and a small bathroom. The ride takes less than two hours and unlike a car ride, takes zero years off your life.Purchase tickets for the bus through Amtrak.Nona played with some toys, got a few snuggles in and availed herself of the bus bathroom.The view of Haystack Rock from Hallmark Resort and Spa.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianWhen we got to Cannon Beach, we got off the bus and headed to the Hallmark Resort and Spa (1400 S. Hemlock St.). I picked the Hallmark because it’s out of tsunami territory, up high on a bluff, across from Haystack Rock, with beach access. (”Wow,” Nona said, when she saw the view.)They also serve warm cookies at check-in, which I failed to note started at 4 p.m.Since it was not yet 11 a.m., we got on a list for early check-in, dropped some bags and walked down Hemlock Street, the Cannon Beach main drag, in search of food.Lunch at Ecola Seafood Restaurant & Market.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianWe opted for fish and chips and clam chowder on the rooftop at Ecola Seafood Restaurant & Market (208 N. Spruce St.). The day was sunny and surprisingly warm and both the salmon and halibut were crispy on the outside and sliding apart inside, everything fish and chips should be. The clam chowder was also good and the toasted, buttery garlic bread reminded me of Mo’s in my childhood in the best possible way.The food isn’t cheap – $26 for a four-piece halibut fish and chips – but there isn’t much cheap food to be found in Cannon Beach or anywhere, at this point.After lunch, we strolled over to Bruce’s Candy Kitchen (256 N. Hemlock St.), an outrageous explosion of sugar that was a high point for the youngest member of our party. We purchased several things, including a pumpkin-shaped chocolate that she happily munched for the next quarter of an hour while we took turns pushing the stroller on the hard sand on the beach.The glory of Bruce’s Candy KitchenLizzy Acker/The OregonianOur room wasn’t ready yet, so we stopped in at Bald Eagle Coffee House (1064 S. Hemlock St.), a utilitarian but sweet little coffee shop connected to an art gallery. The woman behind the counter was absolutely lovely, making a “tepid” vanilla steamer for the youngest, decaf coffee for the oldests, and a black tea for me.The weather continued to be the star of the show – a sunny day on the Oregon Coast is better than a million-dollar lottery jackpot win – and we sat outside, watching the foot traffic on Hemlock Street.After a quick spin through Cannon Beach Book Company (130 N. Hemlock St.), the hotel called and said our room was ready. So back up Hemlock we walked.Our room at the Hallmark was cozy and inviting, with a huge comfy bed, a gas fireplace and a little side window view of the beach. But we didn’t hang out for long. Instead we donned swimsuits and headed to the indoor pool.Hot tub and pool at Hallmark Resort and Spa.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianThe Hallmark has a main pool, with a little one-foot deep side pool “for little kids,” as Nona noted. They also have two hot tubs (one hotter and away from the main pool) and an adults-only sauna.We went back and forth between hot tubs and the pool, enjoying the cornucopia of watery options.After the pool, we dried off and put on clean clothes to walk down the beach for dinner.Cannon Beach is epically walkable, and who really wants a car when you walk from many hotels down a world-class beach to the downtown area, where most of the food is located?Lizzy and Nona on the beach.Lynda BishopSo we walked down the beach, occasionally carrying the three-year-old, and then turned in to walk to Driftwood Restaurant & Lounge (179 N. Hemlock St.).The Driftwood has a gorgeous patio, but unfortunately, minors aren’t allowed. No matter. The inside is full of wood and (electric) candles and vibes. The restaurant is 75 years old and it’s the kind of place your grandpa would love, but so would you.My parents split shrimp Louis, Nona had a grilled cheese, and I opted for the prime rib and prawns special. All the food earned high marks. My prime rib was truly rare, tender and delicious, especially with the horseradish sauce. The Pete’s Mountain pinot noir from West Linn was a great addition, though such a huge glass I couldn’t finish it. The cocktails that my parents tried – a ginger mule and an old fashioned – were strong but tasty.Prime rib and prawns at Driftwood Restaurant & Lounge.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianAfter dinner, we walked back to the hotel along the beach in the dark. There was almost no moon and only two campfires on the beach. Haystack Rock was still visible, black against the sky, and stars and planets were twinkling.We snuggled in the cozy bed, fire on, and watched a little hotel TV (another highlight for Nona), before falling asleep.In the morning, Nona took a bath in the jacuzzi tub in my parents’ room while I walked down another dark, empty beach to Cannon Beach Bakery (240 N. Hemlock St.) to get some breakfast.The pastry case at Cannon Beach Bakery.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianI picked a blueberry muffin, a chocolate muffin, a slice of pumpkin bread and a marionberry scone, all of which were enjoyed by the crowd back at the hotel.We didn’t have too much time to lollygag since the bus picks up in Cannon Beach again at 9:20 a.m. So we checked out and headed to another coffee shop for more pastries because you should always have something for the road. Sleepy Monk Coffee Roasters (1235 S. Hemlock St. A).There are many things to recommend the Sleepy Monk – it’s located right next to the stop where the Point bus picks up, it has great seating outside looking out at Hemlock, the coffee is good (according to my parents), the vanilla steamer is good (according to my daughter) and the orange chocolate scone is very good (according to me).Before long, we were on the bus again, snacking and napping, and then back in Portland, on Trimet and home.

|Portland housing board recommended tenant harassment ordinance; months later, activists say it’s stalled|,|By Jayati Ramakrishnan || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Business,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|A "For Rent" flyer is stapled to a utilities pole in Southeast Portland, on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2021.AP Photo/Sara ClineNEW!By Jayati Ramakrishnan || The Oregonian/OregonLiveMonths after a city rental housing advisory board recommended Portland pursue anti-harassment protections for tenants, a renters rights group says it’s stalled in city Commissioner Dan Ryan’s office.The Portland Rental Services Commission’s proposed rules would ban landlords from making verbal or physical threats to tenants, asking or reporting on an occupant’s immigration status or threatening or coercing a tenant to move out of an apartment they’re legally entitled to inhabit. The commission said it would favor a “gradual approach” to enforcement of the rules, focusing on education and mediation before fining landlords.As evictions return to pre-pandemic levels, and as the Portland City Council has moved urgently to ban street camping, tenant activists said conditions are only growing worse for those at risk of homelessness, and that the council should pay more attention to housing policies.Portland Tenants United last week sent a letter to Ryan, who oversees the Portland Housing Bureau, urging him to bring the tenant protection ordinance to a vote.“We can all agree that preventing homelessness by helping people stay in their homes is an essential part of any plan that aims to address the crisis,” the group wrote.The activist group wrote that it had facilitated introductions between Ryan’s staff and employees from the California cities of Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Berkeley, all of which have enacted anti-harassment ordinances. But PTU said it hasn’t heard back from Ryan’s office since July.Darion Jones, a spokesperson for Ryan, said the commissioner had directed the housing bureau to study anti-harassment ordinances in other cities, and to examine state laws that might preempt one in Portland, even before the Rental Services Commission made its recommendations. He said while some of the work is complete, the housing bureau and city attorney’s office still need to conduct more analysis.Jones said Ryan is working on a variety of rental housing programs including direct rent assistance.“Commissioner Ryan, and the city council are balancing multiple urgencies while working to address them on various levels, from federal advocacy, state legislative action, and local programs,” Jones wrote.The city’s Rental Services Commission wrote in June that public testimony on the subject revealed an increase in landlord harassment and bullying during the pandemic.Seven of the commissioners voted to recommend an anti-harassment ordinance, while two voted against it.Rental Services Commission Co-chair Christian Bryant was one of two who voted against moving forward on the anti-harassment ordinance. Bryant, the president of a property management company and leader of several local and regional rental owner associations, said he felt the ordinance would be redundant.“My vote against it was purely because we currently have state laws that allow tenants to sue landlords that are harassing them,” Bryant said, adding that there are organizations that provide free legal services to tenants. “I didn’t see a need for it. There are already plenty of avenues for a tenant to sue a landlord for harassment, without any up-front costs.”According to the Oregon State Bar, those avenues are not always available.Between 2016 and 2021, Oregon Judicial Department data showed that 98% of eviction cases had at least one party unrepresented by a lawyer. Oregon State Bar spokesperson Kateri Walsh said it has become much more difficult for tenants to find legal help.“At several points this year, our Lawyer Referral Service had virtually no lawyers left who could take landlord/tenant cases,” Walsh wrote in an email. “Most reported that their practices had all that they could handle, and they stopped taking cases.”She said the bar association is trying to alleviate the problem with efforts such as Oregon Free Legal Answers, a website where low-income renters can submit questions and a volunteer lawyer will answer them. Its Modest Means programs has lawyers who will accept clients on a sliding scale, significantly lower than standard legal costs.There may be other hurdles to taking a landlord to court. This year, the apartment industry group Multifamily NW changed its widely used lease template to require disputes be settled in mandatory arbitration rather than the judicial system. (The same lease also includes a clause that prohibits tenants from harassing their landlord verbally, physically or in writing, including “posting untrue statements” online.)Oregon has a statute that prohibits retaliation by landlords against tenants, including by raising rent or interfering with the tenant’s use of their home in response to a complaint. A 2020 state law also limited no-cause evictions.The Portland Rental Services Commission, whose members are appointed by the City Council, is supposed to have members representing different interests — such as landlords, tenants and housing advocates.But between 2018 and 2019, several commissioners representing landlord interests resigned from the board. Reasons included disputes with a renters rights advocate on the board, and disagreements with Mayor Ted Wheeler for supporting landlords paying evicted tenants’ moving costs.Crispin Rosenkranz said he experienced harassment from two separate landlords while renting a Northeast Portland house last year.Rosenkranz moved into the house in March 2020. Five months later, he said, the landlord told him and his roommates that she wanted to sell and offered them $500 each to move out within a month. She said if they didn’t agree, they would be evicted within 90 days.At the time, an eviction moratorium was still in place, and Rosenkranz declined to move.He said the landlord began badgering him to move out, repeatedly calling him with appeals to leave and accusing him of tampering with smoke detectors, an offense that could lead to his eviction.A relative of the landlord moved into another unit on the property and began knocking on the door, sending profane texts telling Rosenkranz to move, and turning off the circuit breaker, Rosenkranz said. He continued to pay his rent the entire time he stayed in the house.Eventually, Rosenkranz’s landlord sold the home, and the new owners also pressured him to leave, he said, and threatened to hold him responsible for rent previously paid by roommates who had moved out.Eventually, Rosenkranz said he hired an attorney and reached a settlement with the new landlord. He received $3,000 and 90 days to move out. But even afterward, Rosenkranz said he received a $2,500 bill from the landlords, billing him for a host of repairs and cleaning.“They charged me to change the locks on the place, to have pest control come out there, lawn stuff,” he said.Rosenkranz’s attorney, Troy Pickard, responded with a letter detailing possible violations by the landlord, such as failing to provide a written account of Rosenkranz’s payment history and accounting for his deposit.The potential liability, the attorney said, was greater than the amount Rosenkranz owed. The property company dropped the bill and paid an amount equal to statutory damages for the claims Pickard outlined.He said it was challenging to know his rights prior to hiring a lawyer, even with the help of friends who are familiar with landlord-tenant law.Amber Cook, a tenant organizer in her own apartment building and an eviction court observer for Portland State University, which is conducting a large research project on eviction, said having the city council’s support of anti-harassment laws would give tenants more support in court.“My hope is that if the city stands up and says, ‘we’re against these forms of harassment and they are defined,’ it’ll give people more in their defense, and give the judges a little more push to take these laws seriously,” she said.—Jayati Ramakrishnan; jramakrishnan@oregonian.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Readers respond: Switch to electric appliances,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianI am stunned by the statement by NW Natural’s spokesperson, David Roy, in your November 12th article “Gas Stoves are Hazardous to Your Health.” Studies by researchers at Harvard University and Stanford University found that gas cooktops release harmful pollutants into a home’s air. These studies strongly support the county’s assertions. It is irresponsible to state that ventilation is the answer, particularly as we simultaneously strive to reduce outside air infiltration through weatherproofing. Reducing emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our homes is vital. Switching to electric appliances is a win-win for a household’s health and for the climate. Today’s electric cooktops are more energy-efficient than gas. An electric cooktop transfers over 70% of its energy to cooking, as compared to 40% for gas. Electric cooktops release no toxic gasses, nor any of the particulate emissions, that contribute to unhealthy air in a building. So-called “natural gas” is up to 95% methane. Methane has 28 times higher heating value than carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere. Any leaks, of which there are many, are a significant contributor to global warming from greenhouse gasses. The 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report stated clearly that reducing methane emissions is our last hope for keeping global warming below the 1.5 degrees centigrade threshold. I urge readers with gas cooktops and ovens to consider your alternatives.

Portland’s hookah lounges could take hit as Multnomah County pursues flavored tobacco ban,|By Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Portland,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|A proposed ban on flavored tobacco in Multnomah County would hinder the three hookah lounges operating in Portland.Oregonian file photoNEW!By Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLiveIf Multnomah County commissioners enact Oregon’s second flavored tobacco ban as expected Dec. 15, Ethan Lewellen will be disappointed.“I’ll be honest, I’m going to be a little sad,” he said.The ban would severely hinder the three existing hookah lounges in Multnomah County, including the one Lewellen visited Sunday, King’s Hookah Lounge in Northwest Portland, he said. As an African American, Lewellen said he looks for opportunities to hang out with people from Portland’s non-dominant culture. He said the ban would be detrimental to the diverse community he finds at hookah lounges, as the flavors are important for business.“It’s a culturally enriching experience, because Portland is a very white city,” Lewellen said. “I always tell people that the pots of diversity here are very rich and unique, primarily because of my exposure and experience here at the hookah lounge.”Lewellen said he understands what the county is trying to do — curb vaping among young people, who may find flavors like blueberry and bubble gum enticing even though they’re illegal for consumers under 21 — but feels that hookah lounges are different from vaping and cigarettes. The crowd is more mature, and he treats it as the equivalent of a coffee shop – sometimes even working from the lounges during the week.King's Hookah Lounge operates in Northwest Portland. An amendment to exempt hookah lounges from a proposed ban on flavored tobacco products in Multnomah County failed Thursday.The board of commissioners on Thursday shot down a proposed amendment from Commissioner Lori Stegmann that would have exempted existing hookah lounges from the ban. Stegmann argued that the lounges act as a cultural gathering place, especially among Middle Eastern and North African residents in Portland.“I support small businesses,” she said. “I support minority-owned businesses. I support the existence of culturally specific spaces and the preservation of them.”Technically speaking, Multnomah County’s proposed ban, which would go into effect in 2024, wouldn’t close its hookah lounges, which operate under an exemption to the state’s Indoor Clean Air Act. It would prevent them from selling flavored products.“It’s kind of disrespectful in a way,” said Christopher Christian, an employee at the 007 Hookah Lounge on Southeast Division Street, in the Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood. “We have different nationalities coming here to get together and share their culture.”Christian has worked at the shop for over a year and said repeat customers are common. He rarely sees college-aged patrons and said they diligently check ID’s at the door. Christian said that the ban feels unnecessary for the hookah shops, whose customer base is not the young teenagers and preteens the new restrictions aim to protect.Flavored tobacco products, also called shisha, are fundamental for the business, Christian said. Without it, he’s not sure if the shop will survive if the ordinance passes. Shisha was originally flavored with molasses and honey.The owner of 007, Salam Zaniel, testified at the Thursday meeting of the county commission and said that hookah is important to his culture and for those who frequent the lounges in their home countries.“As a Muslim, I don’t drink and neither do my friends, so we go to the hookah lounges to hang out and see each other instead of going to bars or clubs,” Zaniel said.In response to the proposed amendment, Commissioner Sharon Meieren pointed out the dangers that smoke inhalation in these lounges pose. During a typical one-hour hookah smoking session, users may inhale 100 to 200 times the amount of smoke they would inhale from a single cigarette, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Washington County commissioners enacted a similar ban in November 2021 under Senate Bill 587, which created a statewide framework to license and regulate tobacco sales. The first-in-Oregon ban went into effect in January but faced a legal challenge from retailers almost immediately and was never enforced.Voters upheld the ban in May, but Washington County Circuit Judge Andrew Erwin ruled in September that SB 587 didn’t permit the ban, which he said must be approved statewide, not county by county.Supporters of the efforts in Washington and Multnomah counties say Erwin ruled in error.The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners will revisit the ban for a second and likely final time on Dec. 15. If passed, it would go into effect in January 2024.– Austin De Dios; adedios@oregonian.com; (503) 319-9744Our journalism needs your support.

|Oregon Measure 114 gun permit-to-purchase system won’t be ready by Thursday, attorney general concedes|,|By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:25 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:16 p.m.|,|1,126|,|The attorney general’s concession echoes what gun rights advocates have argued for the past several weeks and in recent legal briefs filed in pending lawsuits before a federal judge.LC-NEW!1,126sharesBy Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLiveTwo days after telling a federal judge that Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to buy a gun by the end of this week, Oregon’s attorney general Sunday night acknowledged the state isn’t ready to have a permitting process in place as required by the voter-approved gun control Measure 114.In a three-page letter to the court filed at 9:14 p.m. Sunday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall conceded that local law enforcement agencies have made it clear that “necessary pieces of the permit to purchase system will not be in place” by this coming Thursday, the date the measure is set to take effect.The attorney general’s concession echoes what gun rights advocates have argued for the past several weeks and have informed U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut in multiple legal briefs filed in pending lawsuits.The attorney general has recommended the permit requirement be postponed until February while the measure’s other regulations are allowed to go into effect.“The State’s position that Measure 114 is constitutional on its face remains the same,” Marshall’s letter said.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and not allow a gun sale or transfer to occur without a background check completed.The attorney general’s office admitted in its letter to the court that the firearms safety courses that are required before someone can obtain a permit to buy a gun are not yet available.Oregonians should be allowed to continue to buy guns without a permit during a ‘‘limited window,’’ until the state has a full permitting process in place, the attorney general’s letter recommends. Meanwhile, the state will continue to work to get a process up and running, Marshall wrote.“The State’s proposed postponement would mean that, while the permitting system is brought online, Oregonians who lack a permit will be able to purchase and transfer firearms. Meanwhile, the State and local law enforcement would continue to work towards implementing Measure 114′s permit provisions. Moreover, Oregonians would be able to begin the application process. When the Court’s order expires, Measure 114′s permit requirement for purchases would go into effect,” Marshall wrote to the judge.The attorney general’s office pointed to the court declaration by Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association. Myers estimated it will take at least another month to prepare an operational permit system.In a press release, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum recommended the permit to buy a gun requirement be postponed until February.“Postponing the permit requirement by approximately two months should give Oregon law enforcement time to have a fully functional permitting system in place. If Judge Immergut agrees to the postponement, then starting in February anyone who purchases a gun in Oregon will be required to have a permit,” Rosenblum said in the release.Marshall wrote to the court that the state is “committed to working cooperatively with its partners in local law enforcement.”For the measure to achieve its goal of enhancing public safety, “it is critical that local law enforcement has adequate time to effectively implement the Measure,” Marshall’s letter said.Under the measure, anyone applying for a permit to buy a gun must complete a training course that includes instruction on state and federal laws related to purchase, ownership, transfer, use and transportation of guns; safe storage of guns including reporting of lost and stolen firearms; how to prevent the abuse or misuse of firearms, including the impact of homicide and suicide on families, communities and the country; and a demonstration that the applicant knows how to lock, load, unload, fire and store a firearm before an instructor certified by a law enforcement agency.Myers had informed the judge in writing that the sheriffs’ association was unaware of any firearms safety course in Oregon that currently covers all the training requirements.Immergut held a two-hour hearing Friday morning on the Oregon Firearms Federation’s motion for a temporary restraining order to block the regulations from going into effect as its lawsuit proceeds, contending the measure impinges on their Second Amendment right to bear arms.Most of the argument Friday, though, focused on the provision banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.When Immergut asked Marshall during the hearing if the regulations will be ready to take effect on Thursday, he pledged that Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit then. State police later in the day issued a news release, saying a permit application would be on the agency’s website on Thursday.Other suits filed challenging the gun control measure included declarations from the sheriffs’ associations and the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police. They argued that their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective buyers.Immergut had said at the end of last week that she would rule by Tuesday on whether to grant a temporary restraining order that would put the voter-approved measure on hold.The judge has given parties to the pending four federal lawsuits until noon Monday to submit any friend of court briefs in support or against the pending motions for a temporary restraining order.The Rev. Mark Knutson, one of the chief petitioners behind Measure 114, said Sunday night that the Lift Every Voice Oregon interfaith group that obtained signatures to put the measure to voters “wants the most equitable and just process possible...We want this done right to save lives.”William Sack, director of legal operations for the Firearms Policy Coalition that is among the plaintiffs that have challenged Measure 114 in court, said the coalition “is thrilled to see the state of Oregon has joined the rest of us in reality and acknowledged the serious constitutional infirmities with Measure 114. Of course the (Firearms Policy Coalition) and the people of Oregon would’ve preferred to avoid the costly litigation and unnecessary brinksmanship the state’s conduct up until now has necessitated.”Kevin Starrett, executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, said he’s concerned about the tens of thousands of prospective gun buyers currently waiting to have their background checks completed by state police.“A delay in the implementation of the arcane and onerous permit system does not address the backlog of over 30 thousand Oregonians who are being denied their rights even now,” Starrett said.Since Election Day, gun sales in the state have spiked. As of Friday, state police had 41,160 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Attorney Leonard Williamson, who represents the firearms federation, said the attorney general’s concession doesn’t go far enough.Delaying only the permitting process will cause unintended consequences, since some of the pending gun sales that are awaiting completed background checks include guns with magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. If the ban on magazines takes effect Thursday, but the permit system is delayed, gun shop owners won’t let the prospective gun purchaser leave with the magazine their customer had intended to buy, he said.As court challenges to Measure 114 proceed in court, a state interim Judiciary committee has invited the Oregon State Police Supt. Terri Davie and Rebecca David, commander of the state police Public Safety Services Bureau, to address lawmakers at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian https://twitter.com/maxoregonianOur journalism needs your support.

Sports and politics intersect in Georgia Senate runoff Tuesday,By The Associated Press,Nation/World,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:40 a.m.|,None,|Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock campaigns on Sept. 2, 2022, in Atlanta with other members of historically Black fraternities and sororities. Warnock faces Republican Herschel Walker, a former University of Georgia football star, in a Tuesday runoff. Sports and college loyalties have figure prominently in the contest and in other midterm campaigns in this closely divided Deep South battleground. (AP Photo/Bill Barrow)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe reception area of a metro Atlanta office suite is a veritable museum of Herschel Walker’s football success for the University of Georgia Bulldogs and the NFL. The office is part of the Atlanta Braves’ real estate development in the Major League Baseball franchise’s new suburban home.This headquarters for Georgia’s Republican U.S. Senate nominee isn’t officially about athletics, of course. Yet the location and décor help show much professional sports and college loyalties explain political divides in this battleground state, where Walker is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a Tuesday runoff.“Sports are a cultural identifier, and in the South, college fandom is a big part of that,” said David Mowery, a University of Georgia alumnus, avid Bulldogs supporter and now an Alabama-based political consultant who works with Republicans and Democrats. “Now our politics and campaigns are so much about identity,” Mowery said. “We see all these overlaps.”Sports and politics have long intersected in America. But the flashpoints — racial segregation of college campuses and professional leagues, the use of Native American mascots and imagery, athletes protesting over civil rights, power struggles over taxpayer-funding for stadiums — are ever-present in Georgia.For Republicans, whose coalition trends older, whiter and less urban than the general population, that means an open embrace of the Bulldogs and baseball’s Braves, each with fan bases that trend whiter and more suburban and rural. And it’s not just Walker, who carried the Bulldogs to the national championship in 1980 and won the Heisman Trophy two years later.“Great politics, great place to campaign,” said Gov. Brian Kemp, a UGA alumnus, as he tailgated with supporters in Athens ahead of a Georgia game earlier this season.The governor grew up in Athens and is close to the family of the late Bulldog Coach Vince Dooley. His wife, Marty, was a Georgia cheerleader in her student days, he reminded reporters as he previewed the Bulldogs’ 2022 prospects. The defending national champions, he said, “have got the players” but “got to stay humble.” (They won the Southeastern Conference Championship on Saturday.)Kemp and Lt. Gov.-elect. Burt Jones, who also played for Georgia, join Walker in using red and black as their campaign colors. Attorney General Chris Carr, who won a second term in November, sometimes calls himself a “Double Dawg” — the honorific for someone with two UGA degrees.Democrats’ coalition, meanwhile, is anchored by metropolitan areas and nonwhites, who now account for about 4 out of 10 Georgia voters. So, when politicians like Warnock bring sports into their campaigns, it’s to drop by an Atlanta sports bar during the recent World Cup soccer match between the U.S. and Iran.Warnock will campaign Sunday in Athens. But on Saturday, when Walker was at the SEC Championship game, Warnock was in Augusta. The senator visited his alma mater, the historically Black Morehouse College, on Homecoming weekend this fall, but he notes, with a mix of seriousness and humor, a different focus and scale.“You know how it is if you go ... to an HBCU football game,” Warnock told a campaign event of HBCU fraternities and sororities. “It’s not just a game, it’s a fashion show and the Battle of the Bands.”Jason Carter, Democrats’ 2014 nominee for governor, has explained Georgia politics by pointing to Atlanta’s professional soccer team and its demographically diverse fans. “Stacey needs the Atlanta United vote,” he’d say of Stacey Abrams, who lost to Kemp in 2018 and 2022.Certainly, there are white soccer fans in Republican-leaning suburbs and Democrats, white and Black, who love the Bulldogs and Braves. One of Warnock’s top aides organized “Dawgs for Abrams” as a UGA undergraduate in 2018. Nonetheless, the partisan split in campaign styles dovetails with race and geography, even if it’s not explicit.Republican U.S. Senate nominee Herschel Walker, a former University of Georgia football star, greets Georgia football fans Saturday, Dec. 3, 2022 before the Bulldogs' SEC Championship victory over the LSU Tigers in Atlanta. Walker faces Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, in a Tuesday runoff. Walker and Georgia Republicans, especially, have tried to capitalize on sports and college loyalties to connect with voters. (AP Photo/Bill Barrow)APWhen Walker and Kemp chose campaign offices near each other in the Braves’ Cobb County development, Republicans described a straightforward decision to be near metro Atlanta’s northern suburbs so critical to their winning coalition. The Braves themselves had made the same calculation, leaving the city in 2017 after a half-century and explaining the surprise move by saying they’d be closer to most of their season-ticket holders. (Cobb County politicians also gave the team $400 million-plus in stadium financing, something Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed refused to do. Reed instead steered city money to refurbish a downtown arena for the NBA’s Hawks.)Perhaps most notably, Republicans’ embrace of the Braves came alongside controversies over Native American imagery in sports and a separate political tempest over Republicans’ 2021 overhaul of Georgia election laws.Democrats, including Warnock, blasted the law as “Jim Crow 2.0,” claiming it made it harder for some Black voters to cast ballots. Georgia-based corporations Delta and Coca-Cola criticized the law. The Braves stayed out of the fray. But baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred moved the 2021 All-Star Game from Cobb County in response. Kemp blamed “woke” Democrats relentlessly, though Warnock and Abrams didn’t call for the change.The two Democrats also haven’t said the Braves should change their name or abandon fans’ “Tomahawk Chop” at home games, but others, including the Biden White House, have said changes should be on the table.“He need to come out and say, do he believe they should change the name. Well, I don’t,” Walker said in one Fox News appearance. When Warnock largely ignored the issue, a Walker aide tweeted that the senator “must be a Mets fan.”Yet it’s unquestionably Walker’s football acclaim that forges a unique bond between a Black conservative and a multigenerational white political base.“When I was in high school, Herschel Walker was the biggest name in town,” Republican National Committee member Ginger Howard said of the 1980 championship season. Now, she said, her young nephews say excitedly: “Ginger, you know Herschel!”On Saturday, Zach Jacobs and Zach Adams, 23-year-olds from the Atlanta exurb of Woodstock, waited near Mercedes Benz-Stadium downtown to get a picture with Walker. Both voted for their football hero in the general election and said they will again Tuesday.“He’s a man of the people, just connects with who Georgia is,” Jacobs said.Walker has on occasion talked about being among the first generation of Black players at UGA, which was founded in 1785. Dooley, who endorsed Walker before the iconic coach died in October, first offered scholarships to Black athletes in 1971. Walker was 8 years old.Warnock, born in 1969, was not a star athlete and matriculated at Morehouse, which opened its doors during post-Civil War Reconstruction, a founding legacy that Warnock’s fellow HBCU alumni say supersedes athletics.“We have a motto, a program: ‘A Voteless People is a Hopeless People,’” Marcus Montgomery said of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity he shares with the senator.Adams, a white UGA graduate, acknowledged Warnock’s deep Georgia roots.

Those troops are activated by governors to respond to natural disasters or unrest.Congress may consider legislation this coming week to end the mandate as a requirement to gather enough support to pass this years’ defense budget, which is already two months late.Austin said he would not comment on pressure from the Hill.“We lost a million people to this virus,” Austin told reporters traveling with him Saturday. “A million people died in the United States of America. We lost hundreds in DOD. So this mandate has kept people healthy.”“I’m the guy” who ordered the military to require the vaccine, Austin added. “I support continuation of vaccinating the troops.”Last year Austin directed that all troops get the vaccine or face potential expulsion from the military; thousands of active duty forces have been discharged since then for their refusal to get the shots.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Oregon Measure 114: Sheriffs, police chiefs tell judge their agencies are ‘unprepared’ to support gun permit program|,|By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:45 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|,|1,279|,|Jason Myers, who retired as Marion County sheriff and now serves as executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, wrote to a judge in support of a temporary restraining order against Measure 114.Beth Nakamura || StaffNEW!1,279sharesBy Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations have submitted statements to a federal judge, saying their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114, which is supposed to take effect Thursday.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, on Friday submitted separate statements in support of a motion for a temporary restraining order against the new regulations filed by Oregon’s NRA-affiliate, the Oregon State Shooting Association, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.“Measure 114 placed a substantial amount of work on all law enforcement agencies but came with very little direction, no funding, and no additional staffing,” Myers wrote.What is the status of Measure 114?Their submissions to the court come as U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut is deciding whether to grant a temporary restraining order that would put the voter-approved measure on hold as four lawsuits proceed in federal court. The judge said she will issue a written ruling by Tuesday.Each suit argues the regulations violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, while the state attorney general’s office has defended the regulations as critical to stave off mass shootings and reduce suicides and homicides.The measure, which passed with 50.7% of votes, will require a permit to buy a gun; ban the sale, transfer or manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; and require background checks to be completed before a gun is sold or transferred.Both Myers and Campbell said they’ve been consulting with state police as the state police works to put a permit-to-purchase gun program in place by the measure’s effective date.During a court hearing Friday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall assured Immergut that Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit when the measure takes effect on Thursday, drawing laughter from gun rights advocates in the courtroom’s public gallery.State police said they have a draft of a permit application and expect to have a final one available on its website on Thursday.The state police provided the police chiefs and sheriffs associations with a draft permit application last week, but it hasn’t been finalized, Myers and Campbell wrote. State police also advised them that the permit program will be a “paper-heavy” process due to the state agency’s lack of an “electronic infrastructure,” they wrote.A paper process will require sheriff’s offices or police departments to mail or “courier” applications to the state police, Myers wrote, which he said will be time consuming and cause delays in issuing permits.Each also said they’re concerned there isn’t proper training available to meet the measure’s requirements.Under the measure, anyone applying for a permit to buy a gun must provide proof of specific firearms training, some of which can be done online and other parts through in-person demonstration.The training requires instruction on state and federal laws related to purchase, ownership, transfer, use and transportation of guns; safe storage of guns including reporting of lost and stolen firearms; how to prevent the abuse or misuse of firearms, including the impact of homicide and suicide on families, communities and the country; and a demonstration that the applicant knows how to lock, load, unload, fire and store a firearm before an instructor certified by a law enforcement agency.“OSSA is aware of no course in Oregon that has covered all these specific training requirements,” Myers wrote to the court.The sheriffs association “does not believe that anyone in the state will be able to certify that they have received training on each of these very specific subjects at this time,” he added.The sheriffs association and others now provide training required to get a concealed handgun license, but none address all the required training topics under Measure 114, according to Myers.The sheriffs association had opposed the measure when it went before voters.The sheriffs association has since organized a workgroup to recommend how best to put in place the required training, Myers wrote to the court.“Because it is unlikely that anyone can provide certification of training on these specific requirements, every person, including law enforcement officers wishing to obtain a permit, will first have to complete training that does not yet exist,” Myers wrote.Some smaller police agencies require their new officers to buy their own guns for use as duty weapons, wrote Campbell, of the chiefs of police association. But new officers won’t be able to buy a handgun without first getting the training and then a permit to make a purchase, Campbell wrote.“This is likely to cause serious disruption to some of our member agencies whose officers cannot obtain the necessary firearms to perform their police duties,” Campbell wrote. “At this moment, (the Oregon chiefs of police association) believes that there is no way a permit system using municipal police departments as the permitting agents can be operational by December 8th.’’Last week, Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner, president of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the association had invited chiefs to a Zoom meeting on Nov. 22 to discuss what’s needed for local police agencies to process applications to buy guns. He said the police chiefs have a lot of unanswered questions. The association forwarded the chiefs’ questions to the Oregon Department of Justice to try to get some guidance and clarity, he said.Immergut heard two hours of argument Friday, with much of the discussion centered around the measure’s ban on magazines with more than 10 rounds. Little discussion occurred in court about steps taken by the state to support a permit-to-purchase gun program.The judge has given parties to the pending four federal lawsuits until noon Monday to submit any friend of court briefs in support or against the pending motions for a temporary restraining order. She also said it’s entirely within her discretion the extent to which she considers any friend of the court briefs.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

Letter from the Editor: An update on our ‘clean slate’ program,|By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:51 a.m.|,None,|The Oregonian and Oregon Journal archives are available online, and many articles remain available on OregonLive.NEW!By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLiveLast year, I announced The Oregonian/OregonLive would launch a “clean slate” program that allowed subjects of articles to ask us to review old news about minor crimes published on our website. Today, I want to update readers on that effort.To recap, we decided that the lasting effect of publicity for relatively minor scrapes with the law can create an unfair and outsized burden on someone trying to find a job or apartment.Our decision was guided by several factors: Unlike in the past, our archives remain available for many years through search engines; we used to report on minor crimes more often than we currently do and rarely followed up; and society has shifted toward a new approach to helping people rebuild their lives after a criminal conviction.Several other news organizations launched similar programs, notably our sister site Cleveland.com. The shift in society also has led to “ban the box” laws, which prohibit prospective employers from asking about criminal convictions early in the hiring process.Because communities of color are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, there is a racial justice component as well. The lingering existence of a mugshot online following an arrest for a minor crime can become an intractable impediment to gainful employment or housing for people who already face discrimination.Since we launched the review system in mid-2021, our internal committee of reporters and editors has resolved several dozen requests. Their decisions are based on news judgment, common sense and basic fairness.We have five main options when requests come in through our online form: leave things as is; remove a photograph, usually a jail booking mugshot; remove a name; ask Google to de-index the article, which makes it harder to find on OregonLive; or take an article down altogether.We generally won’t consider removing names or articles in the case of violent crimes, sex crimes or crimes against children. We also won’t remove names or stories in cases of public corruption or, at our discretion, in cases where people hold a position of public trust, such as doctors, police officers and schoolteachers.If someone got a court order to set aside a conviction, commonly referred to as expungement, we would weigh that as a factor but would not automatically remove the name or article.Politics and education editor Betsy Hammond helps lead the reviews with public safety editor Margaret Haberman. “Our committee members take this assignment seriously and often spend a long, thoughtful discussion weighing the trade-offs of taking stories down versus keeping them up,” Hammond said.The committee meets periodically, and Haberman said the review can be time-consuming. “Many of the requests have involved reporting, reading court records to check on the outcomes, calling people, verifying claims, which has caused delays in turnaround time,” she said.Here are a few requests and how the committee handled them:A young father addicted to drugs stole some outdoor furniture to feed his addiction in 2003. He moved out of state for a decade before realizing he had an arrest warrant pending. He turned himself in and did his time. Now addiction free, he asked that we remove the article and we did.A woman with mental illness who had stopped taking her medication asked that we remove a 2017 article about an altercation with police. “I take full responsibility for my actions that day and have taken steps to rectify and atone for what transpired,” she wrote. “Today I can proudly say that I have landed back on my feet and was able to procure a stable job.” We removed it.The easiest issue that comes to the newsroom involves jail booking photos. We stopped publishing such photos for routine cases some time ago, and subsequently Oregon law changed to strictly limit the public release of such photos by law enforcement.Such photos are a great example of what we are trying to address: a snapshot of someone’s worst moment, often related to a minor crime, which might end up dismissed, pleaded down or sealed. Yet the demeaning photograph lives on and on and on, just one keyboard search away.We’re very likely to agree to remove booking photographs, given our current practice of not using them unless, say, police release a photo in hopes of apprehending a fugitive.“The process also shows again and again that many of the requests deal with the types of stories we no longer do -- because of their minor nature, because we no longer cover the metro area at that level of detail in all things and because we’ve changed how we cover public safety and handle photos,” Haberman said.Here is the form to request a reviewHammond said some requests were surprising. “We expected people accused of convicted of low-level crimes to request journalistic clemency after a period of years, and they have. But other requests have been quite different.”For instance, The Oregonian used to highlight top students at metro area high schools, writing profiles of them for a feature called Academic Achievers. We receive occasional requests to remove that information due to privacy concerns, problems with stalkers or the wish that the date of their high school graduation not be so public.In another case, a trans person reached out to have a former name removed. “Deadnaming” refers to the use of a name a trans or nonbinary person previously used, such as their birth name. We updated the name.In another, the widow of a man who died in an accident years ago asked that her young children’s names be removed from the article. We agreed to do so.Since the launch of our clean slate program, we haven’t agreed to every request. We declined to remove an article about a man who stabbed his wife. We did agree, in a separate case, to remove the names of children, now grown, mentioned in an article about a man convicted of killing their mother.We said no to a local businessman who had been sentenced to prison for dodging taxes and denied another person’s request to remove an article about a sex abuse conviction involving a minor.We expect the program will continue to evolve as we receive more requests, but we’re pleased with results so far.Our journalism needs your support.

Latest Oregon Measure 114 developments: What is the status of challenges to new gun limits?,By The Oregonian/OregonLive.com,Politics,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:23 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:35 a.m.|,None,|A controversial provision of Oregon Ballot Measure 114 is its ban on high capacity magazines.Jacob Hamilton file photo || For MLive.comNEW!By The Oregonian/OregonLive.comUpdate: The Attorney General of Oregon acknowledged late Sunday the state isn’t ready to have a permitting process in place as required by the voter-approved gun control Measure 114.Oregon’s strict new gun control limits will go into effect Thursday as things currently stand. However, that could change as early as Monday.A federal judge last week heard arguments on the first court challenge to Oregon Measure 114. After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled Dec. 8.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Background check backlogMeantime, Oregon State Police announced that any background check not resolved by Thursday would be held in place until a prospective gun buyer completed the permit requirement put in place by Measure 114. Then, OSP said, the background check process would resume.As of Saturday, Oregon State Police had 42,000 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.OSP's Update on the status of Firearms Instant Check System transactions in the Pended/Delayed Queue as it relates to BM114 - Oregonhttps://t.co/ybYwDa2Nlq pic.twitter.com/QUhT8PrVio— Oregon State Police (@ORStatePolice) December 2, 2022

Increased salesStores like Cabela’s in Tualatin are reporting more gun sales than usual.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” said store manager Richard Dziedzic. The store can handle about 80 people a day for gun sales. He said there was a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m. and the queue was full for the day by the time the store opened at 9 a.m.Permit systemIf the measure becomes state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Thursday. Marshall represented Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, whose office is defending the measure’s constitutionality.The courtroom’s public gallery erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.Update: The state says permits system will not be ready in timeMany law enforcement authorities have said they are working diligently on a system but do not see any way to have fully operational before the law’s enactment date. Additionally, they say the permit system will take resources away from other policing functions.On Friday, the heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations said their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, submitted the statement in support of one of the four lawsuits pending.A new permit application is in “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.Current court challengesThe Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. That challenge was the subject of Friday’s hearing.Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association.A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday. The newly filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.High capacity ammoOne flashpoint is the measure’s ban on magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for other recreational purposes such as hunting, as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.Many Oregon sheriffs have said, if this provision becomes law, they would not place a high priority on enforcing it.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Editorial: Kafoury should leave surplus Multnomah County homeless funds to next board to spend,By The Oregonian Editorial Board,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:27 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:30 a.m.|,None,|Tents are a common sight in the Old Town neighborhood in downtown Portland.  April 30, 2021. Beth Nakamura/StaffThe OregonianNEW!By The Oregonian Editorial BoardMultnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury is developing plans to spend $28 million in surplus housing and homelessness funds in advance of a Dec. 15 board of commissioners meeting. The outgoing chair should instead drop the matter from the agenda and leave the decision for the 2023 board to take up next month.It’s inappropriate for Kafoury to take the lead for such a significant investment just two weeks before her term ends, and her continued bickering with Portland leaders over homelessness initiatives only prolongs our intergovernmental dysfunction. To best position Chair-elect Jessica Vega Pederson for success and acknowledge residents’ widespread frustration with the status quo, Kafoury should gracefully give authority for spending this windfall to those who will have to be accountable for it.We suggested this course of action in an editorial last month, as Portland city officials sought county support for Mayor Ted Wheeler’s plan to create six sanctioned sites for homeless campers. But the need for Kafoury to step back has become even clearer after she sent a letter to Portland city officials last week that could only be read as an attempt to thwart their long-overdue response to the homeless crisis. While City Council’s approval of the plan means Portland will redirect $8 million of the $45 million that it pledged to the county for the Joint Office of Homeless Services, Kafoury’s letter warning of potential impacts was both misleading and revelatory of her flawed understanding of how a “joint” office should operate.In the letter, Kafoury writes that the city’s cut would “require one-time funding to cover shelter operations at the River District Navigation Center and Wy’East Shelter for the remainder of the fiscal year.”That wording, however, is overly prescriptive. As county spokesman Denis Theriault wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, the $8 million is part of the city’s overall allocation, which funds existing shelter, rehousing and street outreach programs. The city did not specify which programs should be cut, and so Kafoury had the Joint Office develop recommendations. By highlighting the navigation center, backed by business interests, and Wy’east Shelter, which serves veterans, it appears Kafoury sought to generate additional pressure on city leaders – a tactic that thankfully did not dissuade City Council from voting yes last week.Certainly, Kafoury is right that losing that $8 million will affect some Joint Office programs if the county does not backfill those dollars. But again, Kafoury does not come clean. As Willamette Week’s Nigel Jaquiss reported, the county budgeted nearly $19 million for spending on shelter, outreach and safety for the 2022 fiscal year that ended June 30, but spent only $9.7 million. So, while Kafoury may legitimately complain that the city is pulling the $8 million from its pledged dollars, the Joint Office failed to spend what the county and city agreed upon. Theriault noted difficulties in hiring for outreach jobs, delays in shelter conversions and other issues, but the fact remains that the county did not invest as it promised to.The letter is misleading in other ways. Kafoury writes that the city has failed to indicate whether it plans to permanently shift $8 million from its Joint Office allocation. She lists several other programs that she says could be cut, if so.But the current City Council cannot bind future City Councils in their annual funding decisions. So, the question posed by Kafoury is one that no one can responsibly answer.And the reality is that the city and county’s funding of the joint office already changes from year to year, sometimes dramatically. The potential for beloved programs or governmental services to be cut is always present, depending on the health of the economy and other factors. In recent years, there’s been more money than anticipated due to strong tax revenue, but that could easily go the other direction if the country falls into recession, as many economists are predicting.Of course, there’s no guarantee that the 2023 board of commissioners would commit any funds to the city’s sanctioned campsites, though Vega Pederson and Commissioner Sharon Meieran have expressed support for the concept. Currently, about half of the Joint Office’s total spending already goes to emergency and temporary shelter. But while the office has funded some small-village type operations and traditional congregate venues, it is spending heavily on converting former motels into shelters – a great option for a limited number of people but a prohibitively expensive way to meet the needs of the thousands living on Portland streets. The Portland plan, while imperfect, recognizes that we need solutions that help a greater share of those thousands. That has not been a priority for Kafoury, who has long viewed permanent housing as the best use of available dollars.There’s no year-end deadline by which the board of commissioners must allocate those funds. There’s no reason the new board can’t take this up in January with Vega Pederson at the helm and her designee, former state. Sen. Diane Rosenbaum, temporarily filling her vacant District 3 seat prior to a special election. Rather, there’s every reason that the county should turn over a new page in its partnership with the city as soon as possible.If Kafoury won’t cede this decision to the next board, the four other commissioners should stand united in insisting on it. They should make clear-eyed decisions on what’s best for the future of the county, and not be pressured into giving Kafoury one last say.-The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board

Opinion: Undoing urban growth boundary isn’t the answer to our housing crisis,|By Guest Columnist || The Oregonian|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:16 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:15 a.m.|,None,|We don’t need to compromise our principles and sacrifice farms and forestlands to development to confront the housing crisis, the authors write. Oregonian file photoLC-NEW!By Guest Columnist || The OregonianSam Diaz, Kim McCarty and Steve MessinettiDiaz is executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon. McCarty is executive director of Community Alliance of Tenants. Messinetti is president and chief executive for Habitat for Humanity Portland Region.In his Nov. 12 column, “Need for housing exceeds all boundaries,” Steve Duin proposes that we address Oregon’s housing crisis by undoing the urban growth boundary. But simply opening up all of Oregon to development won’t solve our housing crisis, though it will exacerbate other challenges in the process. His “solution” will not result in housing options near existing schools, parks, jobs, stores and services that most Oregonians can afford.The urban growth boundary is an innovative policy for designating land for development that continues to achieve its goals of preventing climate-harming and congestion-inducing sprawl while protecting land that grows our food and offers us moments in nature. While improvements can be made to how local governments expand the boundaries, the main problem we face is a lack of equally innovative policies that support the development needed inside our existing urban footprint. Building housing has become more complicated with more expensive and lengthy permitting and land use processes. For many projects, the jurisdictional fees surpass the cost of the land. For example, when Habitat for Humanity develops housing in our region, permitting fees plus “System Development Charges” paid to local jurisdictions generally exceed the market-rate cost for land.Cities across the United States with no urban growth boundaries or zoning - including Houston, Dallas, and Boise - are experiencing similar housing shortages as Portland. Furthermore, previous expansions of the urban growth boundary in the Portland metro region have led to developments of more expensive homes on large lots far from jobs and public transportation - not the places affordable to live in that are so desperately in demand. The takeaway? The urban growth boundary isn’t the make-or-break lever for housing supply or affordability.If turning farms, forests and watersheds into subdivisions won’t solve our housing crisis, what will? We need a comprehensive approach that includes stabilizing renters at risk of eviction, land use policies that encourage density near jobs and transportation, funding to close racial disparities in home ownership, fast-track permitting and fee waivers to encourage affordable housing, and increasing availability of underutilized land within urban growth boundaries.Keep people housed. Expanding the urban growth boundary will not stop evictions and homelessness. The single most cost-effective way to address houselessness is to help prevent people from losing their homes in the first place. Portland State University’s Homeless Research and Action Center forecast at least 125,000 Oregon households at risk of eviction in 2021. It’s already happening – since January, monthly eviction filings have surged with hundreds more a month than in pre-pandemic times. In addition to increased rental assistance, we should look to offer free legal assistance for tenants; support small landlords; enact stronger renter protections; and encourage full utilization of our currently vacant housing.Promote balanced approaches to infill in all neighborhoods and welcome more neighbors. Oregon has landmark legislation to allow duplexes, triplexes and other multi-unit homes in all neighborhoods. Housing density near jobs, transit, schools, services, and community spaces reduces carbon emissions, makes transportation cheaper and more accessible and adds to the diversity and vibrancy of our neighborhoods. To help spur increased development, every jurisdiction should waive fees associated with development and streamline permitting for affordable housing development, with state and federal support when necessary.Give more Oregonians the opportunity to own their home. Even moderately priced housing options are out of reach for many people, especially for Oregonians of color and younger families, many of whom are scrambling to keep up with skyrocketing rents. A path forward is to restrict more properties to be permanently affordable through the community land trust model. In combination with a dedicated revenue stream from the state and local jurisdictions for down payment assistance and subsidies for affordable housing development, this model can facilitate homeownership for households earning low and moderate incomes.Locate and leverage land within the urban growth boundary. Look around our own cities and towns. We have large areas of vacant lands, underused parking lots and empty commercial spaces, all available for building homes. Portland has recently proposed to inventory City-owned land and make all appropriate parcels shovel-ready for affordable housing. Other public agencies should do the same.We don’t need to sacrifice our natural areas or farmland to meet the housing challenge. The real keys to unlocking housing supply and affordability lie within our urban growth boundaries.

Readers respond: Gun measure not draconian,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianI read with disbelief a quote from the Oregon Firearms Federation’s motion for a temporary restraining order and injunction against the implementation of Measure 114, (“Oregon’s gun control Measure 114 subject of emergency motion filed in federal court,” Nov. 24). The federation’s lawyer writes that Measure 114′s “draconian terms turn the Second Amendment on its head…”The definition of a draconian law is one that is excessively harsh. Measure 114 is not draconian by any reasonable measure. It requires a permit to purchase a gun. It bans the sale, transfer or purchase of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. Every other western democracy has gun regulations far more stringent than these. In fact, their governments reacted quickly when they experienced their first mass shootings. It is reprehensible that an appeal to the Second Amendment should supersede the murders of innocent adults and children in 2022.

Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker’s primary residence in Texas was another popular topic.Editorial cartoonists also commented on the end of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s career as the nation’s top infectious disease expert; Biden’s oil deals with Venezuela and Saudi Arabia; Qatar’s treatment of guest workers building facilities for the World Cup; and a threatened rail strike over paid sick leave.Cartoons were drawn by Nick Anderson, Bill Bramhall, Dana Summers, Drew Sheneman, Scott Stantis, Walt Handelsman, David Horsey, Phil Hands, Joel Pett and Joey Weatherford of Tribune Content Agency; and Steve Breen, Mike Luckovich and Michael Ramirez of Creators Syndicate.View more editorial cartoon galleries.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Oregon Measure 114: Sheriffs, police chiefs tell judge their agencies are ‘unprepared’ to support gun permit program|,|By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:45 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|,|1,279|,|Jason Myers, who retired as Marion County sheriff and now serves as executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, wrote to a judge in support of a temporary restraining order against Measure 114.Beth Nakamura || StaffNEW!1,279sharesBy Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations have submitted statements to a federal judge, saying their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114, which is supposed to take effect Thursday.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, on Friday submitted separate statements in support of a motion for a temporary restraining order against the new regulations filed by Oregon’s NRA-affiliate, the Oregon State Shooting Association, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.“Measure 114 placed a substantial amount of work on all law enforcement agencies but came with very little direction, no funding, and no additional staffing,” Myers wrote.What is the status of Measure 114?Their submissions to the court come as U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut is deciding whether to grant a temporary restraining order that would put the voter-approved measure on hold as four lawsuits proceed in federal court. The judge said she will issue a written ruling by Tuesday.Each suit argues the regulations violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, while the state attorney general’s office has defended the regulations as critical to stave off mass shootings and reduce suicides and homicides.The measure, which passed with 50.7% of votes, will require a permit to buy a gun; ban the sale, transfer or manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; and require background checks to be completed before a gun is sold or transferred.Both Myers and Campbell said they’ve been consulting with state police as the state police works to put a permit-to-purchase gun program in place by the measure’s effective date.During a court hearing Friday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall assured Immergut that Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit when the measure takes effect on Thursday, drawing laughter from gun rights advocates in the courtroom’s public gallery.State police said they have a draft of a permit application and expect to have a final one available on its website on Thursday.The state police provided the police chiefs and sheriffs associations with a draft permit application last week, but it hasn’t been finalized, Myers and Campbell wrote. State police also advised them that the permit program will be a “paper-heavy” process due to the state agency’s lack of an “electronic infrastructure,” they wrote.A paper process will require sheriff’s offices or police departments to mail or “courier” applications to the state police, Myers wrote, which he said will be time consuming and cause delays in issuing permits.Each also said they’re concerned there isn’t proper training available to meet the measure’s requirements.Under the measure, anyone applying for a permit to buy a gun must provide proof of specific firearms training, some of which can be done online and other parts through in-person demonstration.The training requires instruction on state and federal laws related to purchase, ownership, transfer, use and transportation of guns; safe storage of guns including reporting of lost and stolen firearms; how to prevent the abuse or misuse of firearms, including the impact of homicide and suicide on families, communities and the country; and a demonstration that the applicant knows how to lock, load, unload, fire and store a firearm before an instructor certified by a law enforcement agency.“OSSA is aware of no course in Oregon that has covered all these specific training requirements,” Myers wrote to the court.The sheriffs association “does not believe that anyone in the state will be able to certify that they have received training on each of these very specific subjects at this time,” he added.The sheriffs association and others now provide training required to get a concealed handgun license, but none address all the required training topics under Measure 114, according to Myers.The sheriffs association had opposed the measure when it went before voters.The sheriffs association has since organized a workgroup to recommend how best to put in place the required training, Myers wrote to the court.“Because it is unlikely that anyone can provide certification of training on these specific requirements, every person, including law enforcement officers wishing to obtain a permit, will first have to complete training that does not yet exist,” Myers wrote.Some smaller police agencies require their new officers to buy their own guns for use as duty weapons, wrote Campbell, of the chiefs of police association. But new officers won’t be able to buy a handgun without first getting the training and then a permit to make a purchase, Campbell wrote.“This is likely to cause serious disruption to some of our member agencies whose officers cannot obtain the necessary firearms to perform their police duties,” Campbell wrote. “At this moment, (the Oregon chiefs of police association) believes that there is no way a permit system using municipal police departments as the permitting agents can be operational by December 8th.’’Last week, Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner, president of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the association had invited chiefs to a Zoom meeting on Nov. 22 to discuss what’s needed for local police agencies to process applications to buy guns. He said the police chiefs have a lot of unanswered questions. The association forwarded the chiefs’ questions to the Oregon Department of Justice to try to get some guidance and clarity, he said.Immergut heard two hours of argument Friday, with much of the discussion centered around the measure’s ban on magazines with more than 10 rounds. Little discussion occurred in court about steps taken by the state to support a permit-to-purchase gun program.The judge has given parties to the pending four federal lawsuits until noon Monday to submit any friend of court briefs in support or against the pending motions for a temporary restraining order. She also said it’s entirely within her discretion the extent to which she considers any friend of the court briefs.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

|Multnomah County public defender shortage leads to criminal cases dropped for alleged child beater, robbers, DUII drivers|,|By Aimee Green || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 10:12 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:00 a.m.|,293,|An empty room at the Multnomah County Central Courthouse in downtown Portland.Motoya Nakamura / Multnomah CountyNEW!293sharesBy Aimee Green || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe list of Multnomah County criminal cases dismissed this year because no public defenders were available to represent the accused is eye-opening, leaving victims awaiting justice that may never come:A visibly swollen and bruised 11-year-old girl who told Fairview police she didn’t want to go home because her mother kept beating her, including that night with a punch to the forehead.A Southeast Portland Plaid Pantry clerk hit in the head by a man who made off with six packs of cigarettes.A Portland area real estate agent who was struck by an alleged drunken driver, suffered seven broken bones and a collapsed lung and has been forced to retire before she was ready.Customers at a Gresham gas station chased around by a woman, with a meth pipe and a knife, who they say tried to set cars and gas pumps on fire with a lighter.A man who was enjoying a drink with friends at a Troutdale bar when investigators say another patron, who was drunk, accidentally shot him in the leg.A TriMet bus driver pepper-sprayed in the face by a passenger.The Oregonian/OregonLive combed through the list of 200-plus felony cases in Oregon’s most populous county dismissed by judges this year because there wasn’t a public defender to spare. While most involved defendants accused of stealing cars, fleeing police or illegally possessing guns, a small but significant swath encompassed face-to-face “person crimes,” where defendants were charged with beating, assaulting or threatening the safety of victims – sometimes even with knives or guns.Chris Day, the TriMet bus driver doused with chemical spray 10 months ago after he says he declined to drop off a passenger half a block before her stop, said it’s “disheartening” to see his case and so many others dismissed. He suspects the passenger had mental health and anger management problems, that without a criminal conviction, have gone unchecked.“The purpose of the court system is to get people the help they need,” he said, “and if they’re not getting the help, things are just going to get worse.”The list of closed cases shines a new and bright light on a long-simmering problem in Oregon and across many parts of the nation: Too few public defenders, too many cases, uncompetitive pay from the state and a system that all sides agree isn’t fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide adequate representation to defendants who can’t afford lawyers.The crisis reached a tipping point early this year, with circuit court judges in Multnomah County for the first time dismissing some cases as the already strained system bowed under increasing shootings, homicides, burglaries, robberies, car thefts and vandalism.The consequences are only now coming into full public view after Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt took the bold step two weeks ago of publicizing the complete list, pledging to update it each week until the situation is resolved. As of Friday, more than 220 defendants accused of felonies and 75 of misdemeanors have seen their cases dismissed since February because there weren’t enough public defenders.Schmidt hopes the attention will foster public understanding that the crisis has not only been hurting criminal defendants who vie for limited time with overworked attorneys, but the general public, too.Schmidt said he understands why judges have resorted to dismissing cases. But, he said, “it’s horrific. My attorneys are trying to explain this to a victim. It’s like, ‘Hey, sorry, your case was dismissed because the defendant didn’t have a lawyer.’ Where are the victim’s rights in that? …We are having to have a lot of awful conversations with people.”He said he’ll refile charges and prosecute all of the cases if the shortage resolves, and already he has had success reactivating a small number. But the future is uncertain. And the clock is ticking, with the statute of limitations for most felonies standing at three years and for most misdemeanors at two.!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();The problem isn’t isolated to Multnomah County. Circuit courts in about 10 of the state’s 36 counties are experiencing public defender shortages. The number currently stands at more than 700 defendants in need of representation. But unlike in Multnomah, by and large those courts haven’t resorted to dismissing cases – yet. The effect, however, is similar: With no lawyer for the defense, some criminal prosecutions have screeched to a standstill.Most notably, about 175 defendants in Washington County – the state’s second most populous county – have been charged and their cases remain open as they wait for an attorney.“To me, it’s a complete breakdown of the system,” said Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton. “The answer to this problem cannot be not prosecuting cases.”Meanwhile, Clackamas County, the state’s third largest county, has been able to avert the crisis so far for a variety of reasons, including a steady number of public defenders willing to work there.‘I’ll never be the same’The dropped cases in Multnomah County have left many victims feeling disillusioned.The Oregonian/OregonLive spoke to five, none of whom wanted to see the people who allegedly committed the crimes locked up simply in the name of justice.But they worried unprosecuted crime will lead to more crime when the perpetrators learn they won’t be sent to jail or prison or ordered into treatment. Under the best of circumstances – when the system is working as it should – defendants who are found guilty but not sent to prison are often connected with drug, alcohol and mental health treatment and sometimes even housing.Or in the case of intoxicated driving defendants, their licenses are suspended or revoked and they’re often ordered to listen to victims of impaired drivers talk about how the crashes devastated their lives.Carol Scalf's Toyota Camry was totaled in a Sept. 2021 crash in which prosecutors say a drunken driver sped into her head-on.Carol Scalf is disappointed to see the driver who struck her in fall 2021 go unprosecuted. On the day of the crash, Scalf, a real estate agent, had been dropping some flyers off at a home she’d listed for sale in North Portland and was driving back to her home in Gresham when prosecutors say an 18-year-old drunken driver struck her. It was shortly before 9 on a Sunday morning. He was charged in January with driving under the influence of intoxicants, reckless driving and assault for striking Scalf and another driver. He made his first court appearance in May but by August saw the case dismissed because the system couldn’t assign him a public defender.Scalf woke up in the intensive care unit with a fractured spine, ankle, ribs and a collapsed lung and a head injury. She said it has been a grueling and slow recovery – 14 months filled with doctors, chiropractor and physical therapy visits.“I’m still not recovered,” Scalf said. “I’ll never be the same again.”Although she was 75 at the time she was hit, she wasn’t planning on retiring any time soon. But she said she’s had to give up her career because of the crash. She also hasn’t been able to drive, because it’s physically and psychologically too much.The Oregonian/OregonLive isn’t naming the driver because a judge dismissed the case against him. Reached by phone, like other former defendants in this story, he declined comment.Multnomah County judges say they don’t want to dismiss cases, but they’re constitutionally obligated to when no lawyer is available to represent the accused.“It’s incredibly frustrating,” said Chief Criminal Judge Cheryl Albrecht. “The statute tells us we shall appoint counsel at the time of arraignment, not later.”TriMet bus operator Chris Day has been assaulted on the job four times.  In Feb. 2022 he was pepper sprayed in the face by a passenger.  The alleged perpetrator is not being prosecuted because Multnomah County doesn’t have a public defender to assign to the case.Dave Killen / The OregonianIn another case, Day, the TriMet bus driver, said just like Scalf he hasn’t been able to work, either. Day said the incident unfolded on the No. 9 line as he waited at a stop light in Gresham, and just as the light was about to turn green, a passenger asked to be let off. Day said he told the passenger he’d open the doors at the next stop, just on the other side of the intersection, but the passenger tried to kick the doors open, got her foot stuck in between them, then took out her fury on Day with the pepper spray. TriMet excluded the passenger from riding the system for 90 days.It’s the third time in 16 years of driving buses that Day said he’s been assaulted, and that doesn’t include a passenger who tried to smear blood on him. Day said he returned to work this spring, but felt uneasy. After spotting the accused passenger at one of the bus line’s stops, he knew he’d need to find another career. Day said his doctor and therapist signed off on putting him on disability.“It’s unbearable,” Day said. “How can I describe it? You don’t know when the next attack is going to come. And you don’t feel protected.”Carl Macpherson, executive director of Metropolitan Public Defenders, the state’s largest public defense firm, said the lack of attorneys for indigent clients is a public safety crisis that harms both defendants and victims. He said he understands why the Multnomah County District Attorney is spotlighting the issue by putting out the list.“I think he’s being open and transparent about the problem,” Macpherson said.Defendants in limboMany are trapped in legal purgatory as their cases are repeatedly delayed without a public defender appointed to represent them.Many players in the criminal justice system – prosecutors and public defenders alike – believe a driving force toward change would be pay parity. Metropolitan Public Defenders, for example, pays $64,000 to $95,000 a year while county prosecutors earn $98,000 to $196,000 annually.But more money would need to come from the state Legislature, because public defenders are paid for from state coffers. And the state entity most equipped to push the issue -- the Office of Public Defense Services and its oversight commission – have been in turmoil. In August, the commission ousted the office’s controversial executive director Stephen Singer.Businesses suffer, tooOf the cases dismissed this year in Multnomah County because of the public defender shortage, about 14% involved assaults or other crimes committed directly against people. Most by far – 53% – involved property crimes such as car thefts, vandalism or burglarized businesses.Jen Causey’s downtown Portland espresso bar, Lotus & Bean, falls into that category. Investigators say at about 4 a.m. this past July, a man who appeared amped up on drugs broke into a jewelry appraisal business on Southwest Third Avenue, then Causey’s coffee shop next door. Once inside, he emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher; tipped over a refrigerator, tables, chairs; threw a new $16,000 espresso maker onto the floor; shattered ceramic mugs and a glass door; and left blood from his cuts splattered across the floor. An arriving officer later wrote that virtually everything that could be broken was.Broken cups and equipment litter the floor of Lotus & Bean on July 18, 2022.“Honestly, I was just kind of shocked that one person could do all that,” Causey told The Oregonian/OregonLive.Causey said the man easily wreaked more than $50,000 in damage, which she said she’s thankful her insurance covered. But even so, the incident forced her to close for three weeks to clean up and wait for new equipment.She doesn’t, however, hold any ill will against the man who did it, whom she said she looked up on Facebook and discovered is middle-aged, has three children and has been in and out of rehab. But she wonders what will get him to return to drug treatment now that his court case has been dismissed.“He has a very significant addiction that needs to be addressed,” Causey said. “I want him to get some help.”It’s been a particularly tough year for Portland’s business community, which reports an onslaught of vandalism, thefts and property crimes against them. Just last month, startling numbers released by prosecutors show Portland police referred just 2% of theft cases to the district attorney’s office for prosecution because of their struggles to track down and build cases against the vast majority of suspects.Also last month, a co-founder of Salt & Straw ice cream shops said the company would move its Southeast Portland headquarters out of state if the city didn’t get a handle on crime. In response, Mayor Ted Wheeler held a summit this past week with business owners to talk solutions.Many of the cases on Multnomah County’s dismissed cases list would have never seen the light of day in a courtroom if it weren’t for chance discoveries by police.Case in point, a pair of thieves were caught on surveillance video breaking into Campfire Audio’s warehouse in inner Southeast Portland in March and making off with $240,000 of the high-end earphones the company manufactures.With police resources strapped, employees searched online sites and found their products for sale. A friend of an employee spotted a man selling their product out of the trunk of his car at a flea market. But it wasn’t until a month later that a Portland cop struck up a conversation with a suspect, noticed a pair of fancy earphones on him and then discovered thousands of dollars of the stolen earpieces in his truck.The man was charged with theft. But a few months later, a judge dismissed the case for lack of a public defender.Campfire Audio’s vice president, Caleb Rosenau, said while the burglary was like a punch to the gut, his company has significantly beefed up security and is here to stay. He just hopes police, prosecutors and the courts work out solutions – finding some way to hold offenders accountable. That might start with stable housing, mental health treatment and drug treatment to stop the need to feed their addictions, he said.“We’re very much not interested in moving,” Rosenau said, “because we care about the city and we want the city to get better.”!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

Letter from the Editor: An update on our ‘clean slate’ program,|By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 8:47 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:51 a.m.|,None,|The Oregonian and Oregon Journal archives are available online, and many articles remain available on OregonLive.NEW!By Therese Bottomly || The Oregonian/OregonLiveLast year, I announced The Oregonian/OregonLive would launch a “clean slate” program that allowed subjects of articles to ask us to review old news about minor crimes published on our website. Today, I want to update readers on that effort.To recap, we decided that the lasting effect of publicity for relatively minor scrapes with the law can create an unfair and outsized burden on someone trying to find a job or apartment.Our decision was guided by several factors: Unlike in the past, our archives remain available for many years through search engines; we used to report on minor crimes more often than we currently do and rarely followed up; and society has shifted toward a new approach to helping people rebuild their lives after a criminal conviction.Several other news organizations launched similar programs, notably our sister site Cleveland.com. The shift in society also has led to “ban the box” laws, which prohibit prospective employers from asking about criminal convictions early in the hiring process.Because communities of color are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, there is a racial justice component as well. The lingering existence of a mugshot online following an arrest for a minor crime can become an intractable impediment to gainful employment or housing for people who already face discrimination.Since we launched the review system in mid-2021, our internal committee of reporters and editors has resolved several dozen requests. Their decisions are based on news judgment, common sense and basic fairness.We have five main options when requests come in through our online form: leave things as is; remove a photograph, usually a jail booking mugshot; remove a name; ask Google to de-index the article, which makes it harder to find on OregonLive; or take an article down altogether.We generally won’t consider removing names or articles in the case of violent crimes, sex crimes or crimes against children. We also won’t remove names or stories in cases of public corruption or, at our discretion, in cases where people hold a position of public trust, such as doctors, police officers and schoolteachers.If someone got a court order to set aside a conviction, commonly referred to as expungement, we would weigh that as a factor but would not automatically remove the name or article.Politics and education editor Betsy Hammond helps lead the reviews with public safety editor Margaret Haberman. “Our committee members take this assignment seriously and often spend a long, thoughtful discussion weighing the trade-offs of taking stories down versus keeping them up,” Hammond said.The committee meets periodically, and Haberman said the review can be time-consuming. “Many of the requests have involved reporting, reading court records to check on the outcomes, calling people, verifying claims, which has caused delays in turnaround time,” she said.Here are a few requests and how the committee handled them:A young father addicted to drugs stole some outdoor furniture to feed his addiction in 2003. He moved out of state for a decade before realizing he had an arrest warrant pending. He turned himself in and did his time. Now addiction free, he asked that we remove the article and we did.A woman with mental illness who had stopped taking her medication asked that we remove a 2017 article about an altercation with police. “I take full responsibility for my actions that day and have taken steps to rectify and atone for what transpired,” she wrote. “Today I can proudly say that I have landed back on my feet and was able to procure a stable job.” We removed it.The easiest issue that comes to the newsroom involves jail booking photos. We stopped publishing such photos for routine cases some time ago, and subsequently Oregon law changed to strictly limit the public release of such photos by law enforcement.Such photos are a great example of what we are trying to address: a snapshot of someone’s worst moment, often related to a minor crime, which might end up dismissed, pleaded down or sealed. Yet the demeaning photograph lives on and on and on, just one keyboard search away.We’re very likely to agree to remove booking photographs, given our current practice of not using them unless, say, police release a photo in hopes of apprehending a fugitive.“The process also shows again and again that many of the requests deal with the types of stories we no longer do -- because of their minor nature, because we no longer cover the metro area at that level of detail in all things and because we’ve changed how we cover public safety and handle photos,” Haberman said.Here is the form to request a reviewHammond said some requests were surprising. “We expected people accused of convicted of low-level crimes to request journalistic clemency after a period of years, and they have. But other requests have been quite different.”For instance, The Oregonian used to highlight top students at metro area high schools, writing profiles of them for a feature called Academic Achievers. We receive occasional requests to remove that information due to privacy concerns, problems with stalkers or the wish that the date of their high school graduation not be so public.In another case, a trans person reached out to have a former name removed. “Deadnaming” refers to the use of a name a trans or nonbinary person previously used, such as their birth name. We updated the name.In another, the widow of a man who died in an accident years ago asked that her young children’s names be removed from the article. We agreed to do so.Since the launch of our clean slate program, we haven’t agreed to every request. We declined to remove an article about a man who stabbed his wife. We did agree, in a separate case, to remove the names of children, now grown, mentioned in an article about a man convicted of killing their mother.We said no to a local businessman who had been sentenced to prison for dodging taxes and denied another person’s request to remove an article about a sex abuse conviction involving a minor.We expect the program will continue to evolve as we receive more requests, but we’re pleased with results so far.Our journalism needs your support.

Latest Oregon Measure 114 developments: What is the status of challenges to new gun limits?,By The Oregonian/OregonLive.com,Politics,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:23 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:35 a.m.|,None,|A controversial provision of Oregon Ballot Measure 114 is its ban on high capacity magazines.Jacob Hamilton file photo || For MLive.comNEW!By The Oregonian/OregonLive.comUpdate: The Attorney General of Oregon acknowledged late Sunday the state isn’t ready to have a permitting process in place as required by the voter-approved gun control Measure 114.Oregon’s strict new gun control limits will go into effect Thursday as things currently stand. However, that could change as early as Monday.A federal judge last week heard arguments on the first court challenge to Oregon Measure 114. After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled Dec. 8.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Background check backlogMeantime, Oregon State Police announced that any background check not resolved by Thursday would be held in place until a prospective gun buyer completed the permit requirement put in place by Measure 114. Then, OSP said, the background check process would resume.As of Saturday, Oregon State Police had 42,000 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.OSP's Update on the status of Firearms Instant Check System transactions in the Pended/Delayed Queue as it relates to BM114 - Oregonhttps://t.co/ybYwDa2Nlq pic.twitter.com/QUhT8PrVio— Oregon State Police (@ORStatePolice) December 2, 2022

Increased salesStores like Cabela’s in Tualatin are reporting more gun sales than usual.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” said store manager Richard Dziedzic. The store can handle about 80 people a day for gun sales. He said there was a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m. and the queue was full for the day by the time the store opened at 9 a.m.Permit systemIf the measure becomes state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Thursday. Marshall represented Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, whose office is defending the measure’s constitutionality.The courtroom’s public gallery erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.Update: The state says permits system will not be ready in timeMany law enforcement authorities have said they are working diligently on a system but do not see any way to have fully operational before the law’s enactment date. Additionally, they say the permit system will take resources away from other policing functions.On Friday, the heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations said their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, submitted the statement in support of one of the four lawsuits pending.A new permit application is in “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.Current court challengesThe Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. That challenge was the subject of Friday’s hearing.Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association.A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday. The newly filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.High capacity ammoOne flashpoint is the measure’s ban on magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for other recreational purposes such as hunting, as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.Many Oregon sheriffs have said, if this provision becomes law, they would not place a high priority on enforcing it.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Readers respond: Gun measure not draconian,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianI read with disbelief a quote from the Oregon Firearms Federation’s motion for a temporary restraining order and injunction against the implementation of Measure 114, (“Oregon’s gun control Measure 114 subject of emergency motion filed in federal court,” Nov. 24). The federation’s lawyer writes that Measure 114′s “draconian terms turn the Second Amendment on its head…”The definition of a draconian law is one that is excessively harsh. Measure 114 is not draconian by any reasonable measure. It requires a permit to purchase a gun. It bans the sale, transfer or purchase of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. Every other western democracy has gun regulations far more stringent than these. In fact, their governments reacted quickly when they experienced their first mass shootings. It is reprehensible that an appeal to the Second Amendment should supersede the murders of innocent adults and children in 2022.

Oregon Measure 114 means long lines at gun stores as judge considers challenge,|By Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:40 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 6:01 p.m.|,218,|The queue to purchase or pick up firearms at the Tualatin Cabela's filled up by 9 a.m. Saturday as Oregonians rush to purchase guns before Measure 114 goes into effect.NEW!218sharesBy Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLiveWith Measure 114 scheduled to go into effect Dec. 8, Oregonians attempting to buy guns are experiencing crowded lines and days long waits for background checks as the state sees a surge in purchases.As part of Oregon’s existing laws, anyone buying a gun in the state must pass a background check handled by the Oregon State Police. The surge in gun sales has created a backlog of 42,000 pending background checks, according to spokesperson Kyle Kennedy.The Cabela’s in Tualatin has implemented a queue system to handle the demand. Shoppers looking to buy or pick up a gun from the store scan a QR code to be placed in a waiting queue.The queue can only hold 70 to 80 people a day, and with a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m., it filled up by the time the store opened Saturday, according to store manager Richard Dziedzic. It can take all day to get through the list.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” Dziedric said.Dziedric said Cabela’s has tried its best to help every customer, but the bottleneck in background checks has forced them to turn some people away.Customers at the Portland Sportsman’s Warehouse also lined the store Saturday – many holding a small slip of paper indicating their spot in line to pick up or purchase a firearm. Some had been waiting upwards of an hour.Jason Bray, one of the dozens at Sportsman’s Warehouse picking up a firearm, was there for a hunting rifle he ordered online. He said the changing gun regulations didn’t influence his rifle purchase, but that he had ordered some magazines for another gun ahead of Measure 114, which will ban the sale and transfer of magazines with more than 10 rounds.In addition to limiting magazine capacity, the measure will require a permit to purchase a gun in the state.“There’s kind of a frenzy here,” Bray said. “But, personally, I think it’s a waste of time. The only way to fix the problem is to repeal 114.”Controversy over the new gun regulations continued Friday in a federal hearing on whether Measure 114′s regulations are constitutional. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said that she will issue a ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled.– Austin De Dios; adedios@oregonian.com; (503) 319-9744Our journalism needs your support.

Online sleuths in stabbing deaths of 4 Idaho students seek answers to key questions,By The Associated Press,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 6:28 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 7:40 a.m.|,None,|FILE - The moon rises on Nov. 29, 2022, as a Moscow police officer stands guard in his vehicle at the home where four University of Idaho students were found dead on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe deaths of four University of Idaho students nearly three weeks ago has riled up thousands of would-be armchair sleuths, many of whom are posting speculation and unfounded rumors about the fatal stabbings online.Relatively few details have been released in the horrific case that has left the small town of Moscow stunned and grieving for Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.The unanswered questions are fueling extensive interest in details about what happened. Here is a look at what is known about the killings, and what remains a mystery:IS THERE A SUSPECT?The Moscow Police Department has not yet named a suspect or made any arrests. Investigators have also not yet found a weapon, the department wrote in a news release Wednesday. Autopsies determined the four students were stabbed to death, likely with a fixed-blade knife, and investigators checked with local stores to see if any had sold military-style knives recently.FILE - People attending a vigil for the four University of Idaho students who were killed on Nov. 13, 2022, hold up their phones during a moment of silence on Nov. 30, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation.(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APWHO WERE THE VICTIMS?All four were friends and members of the university’s Greek system. Xana Kernodle, 20, was a junior studying marketing. She was from Post Falls, Idaho, and joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority on campus. She lived at the rental home with the other two women who were stabbed, and she was dating Ethan Chapin, who was visiting the night of the killings.Chapin, also 20, was from Mount Vernon, Washington and was a triplet. His brother and sister also attend UI, and both Chapin and his brother were members of the Sigma Chi fraternity.Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were both 21 and friends who grew up together in northern Idaho. Mogen worked with Kernodle at a local Greek restaurant in Moscow. She was also a member of Pi Beta Phi.Goncalves was a senior majoring in general studies, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority and was planning a trip to Europe next year.WERE THE VICTIMS TARGETED?It’s unclear whether the killer or killers knew the victims. Police and the county prosecutor’s office have released confusing — and at times contradictory — statements about whether the victims were “targeted.”On Thursday, the police department issued this statement: “We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants.”Investigators say nothing appears to have been stolen from the home.WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT AND MORNING OF THE ATTACK?Goncalves and Mogen went to a local bar, stopped at a food truck and then caught a ride home with a private party around 1:56 a.m., according to a police timeline of the evening.Chapin and Kernodle were at the Sigma Chi house — just a short walk away — and returned to Kernodle’s house around 1:45 a.m., police said.Two other roommates who live in the home were also out that evening, but returned home by 1 a.m., police said. They didn’t wake up until later that morning.After they woke up, they called friends to come to the house because they believed one of the victims found on the second floor had passed out and wasn’t waking up. At 11:58 a.m., someone inside the home called 911, using a roommate’s cell phone. Multiple people talked with the dispatcher before police arrived.Police found two of the victims on the second floor of the three-story home, and two on the third floor. A dog was also at the home, unharmed.Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault, police said.HAS ANYONE BEEN CLEARED?Police say that neither the two surviving roommates nor anyone who was at the home during the 911 call are believed to be involved with the attack. Police also say some of the people seen out with Goncalves and Mogen, including the person who drove them home, are not believed to be involved.A sixth person is also listed on the rental lease for the house, police revealed Thursday, but detectives do not believe that person was at home during the attack.FILE - Officers investigate the deaths of four University of Idaho students at an apartment complex south of campus on Nov. 14, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP, File)APARE OTHER AGENCIES HELPING WITH THE INVESTIGATION?A lot of manpower and resources have been focused on the investigation. Idaho Gov. Brad Little has made $1 million in emergency funding available for the investigation.The Moscow Police Department has four detectives and dozens of officers on the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has assigned more than 40 agents, with about half stationed in Moscow. The Idaho State Police has roughly 20 investigators assisting, and several troopers patrolling the town.IS THERE ANY THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY?Police initially said there was no threat to the community, then later walked back that statement. Because the killer (or killers) is unknown, and because whether the attack was “targeted” is hazy, many in the community are fearful.The University of Idaho has allowed students to switch to fully remote learning, and Dean of Students Blaine Eckles said Wednesday that less than half of the students left campus in favor of online classes.The university has also hired an additional security firm to help with campus safety. Students can request escorts while on campus.DID ANY OF THE VICTIMS RAISE SECURITY CONCERNS BEFORE THE ATTACKS?Neither the university nor the police department have said whether any of the students reported unusual activity or expressed safety concerns in the months or weeks before the attack.The police department has looked into reports that Goncalves may have had a stalker, but despite pursuing hundreds of tips, has been unable to verify that claim, according to a " Frequently Asked Questions " document released by the department.WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE PERSON? OR SO-AND-SO?Rumors, speculation and unfounded theories abound online, many targeting people that police have already said aren’t involved in the crime.“There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,” the police department wrote in a Facebook post Thursday evening. “We encourage referencing official releases for accurate information and updated progress.”Police frequently hold back some information about criminal cases because releasing it could harm the investigation. Sometimes crucial evidence doesn’t become publicly known until after an arrest is made and the case goes to trial.Detectives are looking for tips, surveillance videos from the area and other information that could provide context about the killings. They are asking that people call or email the police department with tips and upload any digital media to a special FBI website.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Salt & Straw looks for Portland turning point as its plight divides, unites: Steve Duin column|,|By Steve Duin || For The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:26 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 7:07 a.m.|,None,|Salt & Straw's Central Eastside Industrial District headquartersNEW!By Steve Duin || For The Oregonian/OregonLiveSalt & Straw got its start at a pushcart in the Alberta Arts District, fresh ice cream arriving in the cooler strapped to the roof of Tyler Malek’s blue Subaru. While Kim and Tyler Malek are now selling small-batch ice-cream in Disneyland and Miami’s Coconut Grove, the cousins’ sense of – and belief in – community was shaped by the city where it all began.In the last six months, the Maleks’ faith in Portland hasn’t been threatened. But their employees have, repeatedly, near the 15,000-square-foot kitchen Salt & Straw opened in the Central Eastside Industrial District in 2017.“Threatened. Propositioned for sex. Followed with a knife,” Kim Malek says. “They work a full shift, then go out and find their car so damaged they can’t drive home. That happens a lot. Several times a month.“We have 50 employees who show up at all hours of the day and night, to make ice cream and take care of the facility. It’s not responsible of me to allow them to show up where they have a gun put to their face when they walk from their transportation to the front door at nine in the morning.”Tyler and Kim MalekKim Malek’s distress peaked early last week when an RV, sleeping quarters for the homeless, went up in flames at Southeast 3rd Avenue and Ash Street. The fire scorched a transformer, shutting down power at Salt & Straw headquarters and other area businesses.Malek didn’t go public with her frustration. A friend, Thomas Lauderdale, did. When she was eventually interviewed by The Oregonian/OregonLive, Malek raised the possibility of moving the company headquarters out of Southeast: “If we can’t make it safe, I can’t stay here. It’s just not responsible of me to put my team in that position.”Running a Portland business is quite the slog these days. Margins are thin. Business taxes are brutal, costs inflated. “Hiring” signs are everywhere. You have to wonder who couldn’t relate to an innovated, dedicated business owner at the breaking point.Thanks to Twitter, wonder no more.“Can you imagine a corporation that would threaten to leave a city because someone’s home burned down near their headquarters?” wrote Elliott Young, a history professor at Lewis & Clark College. “Instead of offering help, Salt & Straw wants to pack up its waffle cones and flee to the burbs. Enjoy your gated community.”Can you imagine a corporation that would threaten to leave a city because someone’s home burned down near their headquarters?

Then there was this from Wm. Steven Humphrey, editor of The Mercury:“Many Mercury employees (including myself) have been shot at, tear gassed and assaulted by law enforcement – all while trying to do our jobs. It hasn’t occurred to me once to move my business ‘out of state.’”Many Mercury employees (including myself) have been shot at, tear gassed, and assaulted by law enforcement—all while trying to do our jobs. It hasn't occurred to me once to move my business "out of state."— Wm. Steven Humphrey (@WmSteveHumphrey) November 24, 2022

That’s a curious analogy, Mr. Humphrey, given that your employees – bless ‘em all – are paid to run toward the smoke and fire, while Kim Malek’s are paid to whip up Almond Brittle w/ Salted Ganache.What accounts for these kneejerk reactions? As Malek says, “I’m asking for help to keep my employees safe. That’s all I’m asking for.” When a (relatively) small business owner candidly expresses her concern for the safety of her team and the health of her city, what invites such mockery and disdain?Young, who lives not far from Cleveland High School in Southeast, was kind enough to elaborate on the perspective he brought to that tweet.“It was a reaction to a corporation dealing with problems in a city that has been supportive of their business,” Young says. “Offering solutions on how local businesses could deal with homelessness and crime in that neighborhood would be a better corporate response than leaving the city.”Young also argues that – notwithstanding the city’s record-breaking homicide rate and those smash-and-grabs at the Pearl District REI – “crime rates are at historic lows. Obviously, people want them to be lower, but I don’t think the solution is increased policing.” Malek’s appeal, he adds, “seemed to be a call for increased policing, and I think that’s how the city is responding to it.”At the very least, then, Young’s convictions about police and crime are at odds with the on-the-ground experience of Salt & Straw employees. And when that disagreement is amplified in the sullen echo chamber of social media?“This is hard,” Kim Malek says. “I don’t want to throw gasoline on the fire. But our stores have gotten phone calls and threats since I spoke out. And (there have been) threats to me personally.”On Thursday, Mayor Ted Wheeler told me, “This is well-trodden ground for me. People who speak out, and who don’t carry a far-left viewpoint, put themselves at risk in this city.”He mentioned the vandalism at the Bison Coffeehouse in October after Loretta Guzman, the Cully café's owner, advertised a Coffee with a Cop event: “What she got in exchange for that was six people trashing the store.”Malek and her neighbors certainly have the city’s attention. Wheeler, who believes clean-up efforts in Old Town may have heightened crime issues on the central eastside, took the stage at the Eastside Exchange ballroom Tuesday night to field complaints.And Malek, who says she has no time for Twitter, is encouraged by the support she’s received since this story broke.“You know who has really showed up? All of our elected officials,” Malek says. “There’s new leadership in a lot of positions. Windows are starting to open. I feel really hopeful for the first time in a few years. I think that’s so important for Portland to hear. We need some hope. We need a way out of this.”-- Steve Duinstephen.b.duin@gmail.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

He died at a local hospital from gunshot wound or wounds, the medical examiner later determined.Sometime in the past three weeks, homicide detectives identified a suspect. With an arrest warrant — and the help of special police teams and the U.S. Marshal’s office — they arrested Thomas Nathaniel Tibball, 24 of Portland on Thursday in the 12000 block of Southeast Ash Street, down the street from where the shooting took place.Tibball was interviewed by detectives and charged with second-degree murder, unlawful use of a weapon and being a felon in possession of a firearm, but the homicide investigation is not complete, according to a news release from the Portland Police Bureau.According to court records, Tibball was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon in 2022, identity theft and attempted robbery in 2020 and attempted robbery in 2015.Logan, the victim, was identified in court documents as houseless when he was arrested in October for allegedly trespassing and refusing to leave the Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Northwest Portland.At least 15 other people experiencing homelessness have been killed in Portland this year.With three weeks remaining in the calendar year, 95 people have died by homicide in Portland, most in shootings. The toll has surpassed the year-end total for 2021, which concluded with a record-breaking 92 homicides.-- Savannah Eadens; seadens@oregonian.com; 503-221-6651; @savannaheadensIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

|Portland housing board recommended tenant harassment ordinance; months later, activists say it’s stalled|,|By Jayati Ramakrishnan || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Business,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|A "For Rent" flyer is stapled to a utilities pole in Southeast Portland, on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2021.AP Photo/Sara ClineNEW!By Jayati Ramakrishnan || The Oregonian/OregonLiveMonths after a city rental housing advisory board recommended Portland pursue anti-harassment protections for tenants, a renters rights group says it’s stalled in city Commissioner Dan Ryan’s office.The Portland Rental Services Commission’s proposed rules would ban landlords from making verbal or physical threats to tenants, asking or reporting on an occupant’s immigration status or threatening or coercing a tenant to move out of an apartment they’re legally entitled to inhabit. The commission said it would favor a “gradual approach” to enforcement of the rules, focusing on education and mediation before fining landlords.As evictions return to pre-pandemic levels, and as the Portland City Council has moved urgently to ban street camping, tenant activists said conditions are only growing worse for those at risk of homelessness, and that the council should pay more attention to housing policies.Portland Tenants United last week sent a letter to Ryan, who oversees the Portland Housing Bureau, urging him to bring the tenant protection ordinance to a vote.“We can all agree that preventing homelessness by helping people stay in their homes is an essential part of any plan that aims to address the crisis,” the group wrote.The activist group wrote that it had facilitated introductions between Ryan’s staff and employees from the California cities of Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Berkeley, all of which have enacted anti-harassment ordinances. But PTU said it hasn’t heard back from Ryan’s office since July.Darion Jones, a spokesperson for Ryan, said the commissioner had directed the housing bureau to study anti-harassment ordinances in other cities, and to examine state laws that might preempt one in Portland, even before the Rental Services Commission made its recommendations. He said while some of the work is complete, the housing bureau and city attorney’s office still need to conduct more analysis.Jones said Ryan is working on a variety of rental housing programs including direct rent assistance.“Commissioner Ryan, and the city council are balancing multiple urgencies while working to address them on various levels, from federal advocacy, state legislative action, and local programs,” Jones wrote.The city’s Rental Services Commission wrote in June that public testimony on the subject revealed an increase in landlord harassment and bullying during the pandemic.Seven of the commissioners voted to recommend an anti-harassment ordinance, while two voted against it.Rental Services Commission Co-chair Christian Bryant was one of two who voted against moving forward on the anti-harassment ordinance. Bryant, the president of a property management company and leader of several local and regional rental owner associations, said he felt the ordinance would be redundant.“My vote against it was purely because we currently have state laws that allow tenants to sue landlords that are harassing them,” Bryant said, adding that there are organizations that provide free legal services to tenants. “I didn’t see a need for it. There are already plenty of avenues for a tenant to sue a landlord for harassment, without any up-front costs.”According to the Oregon State Bar, those avenues are not always available.Between 2016 and 2021, Oregon Judicial Department data showed that 98% of eviction cases had at least one party unrepresented by a lawyer. Oregon State Bar spokesperson Kateri Walsh said it has become much more difficult for tenants to find legal help.“At several points this year, our Lawyer Referral Service had virtually no lawyers left who could take landlord/tenant cases,” Walsh wrote in an email. “Most reported that their practices had all that they could handle, and they stopped taking cases.”She said the bar association is trying to alleviate the problem with efforts such as Oregon Free Legal Answers, a website where low-income renters can submit questions and a volunteer lawyer will answer them. Its Modest Means programs has lawyers who will accept clients on a sliding scale, significantly lower than standard legal costs.There may be other hurdles to taking a landlord to court. This year, the apartment industry group Multifamily NW changed its widely used lease template to require disputes be settled in mandatory arbitration rather than the judicial system. (The same lease also includes a clause that prohibits tenants from harassing their landlord verbally, physically or in writing, including “posting untrue statements” online.)Oregon has a statute that prohibits retaliation by landlords against tenants, including by raising rent or interfering with the tenant’s use of their home in response to a complaint. A 2020 state law also limited no-cause evictions.The Portland Rental Services Commission, whose members are appointed by the City Council, is supposed to have members representing different interests — such as landlords, tenants and housing advocates.But between 2018 and 2019, several commissioners representing landlord interests resigned from the board. Reasons included disputes with a renters rights advocate on the board, and disagreements with Mayor Ted Wheeler for supporting landlords paying evicted tenants’ moving costs.Crispin Rosenkranz said he experienced harassment from two separate landlords while renting a Northeast Portland house last year.Rosenkranz moved into the house in March 2020. Five months later, he said, the landlord told him and his roommates that she wanted to sell and offered them $500 each to move out within a month. She said if they didn’t agree, they would be evicted within 90 days.At the time, an eviction moratorium was still in place, and Rosenkranz declined to move.He said the landlord began badgering him to move out, repeatedly calling him with appeals to leave and accusing him of tampering with smoke detectors, an offense that could lead to his eviction.A relative of the landlord moved into another unit on the property and began knocking on the door, sending profane texts telling Rosenkranz to move, and turning off the circuit breaker, Rosenkranz said. He continued to pay his rent the entire time he stayed in the house.Eventually, Rosenkranz’s landlord sold the home, and the new owners also pressured him to leave, he said, and threatened to hold him responsible for rent previously paid by roommates who had moved out.Eventually, Rosenkranz said he hired an attorney and reached a settlement with the new landlord. He received $3,000 and 90 days to move out. But even afterward, Rosenkranz said he received a $2,500 bill from the landlords, billing him for a host of repairs and cleaning.“They charged me to change the locks on the place, to have pest control come out there, lawn stuff,” he said.Rosenkranz’s attorney, Troy Pickard, responded with a letter detailing possible violations by the landlord, such as failing to provide a written account of Rosenkranz’s payment history and accounting for his deposit.The potential liability, the attorney said, was greater than the amount Rosenkranz owed. The property company dropped the bill and paid an amount equal to statutory damages for the claims Pickard outlined.He said it was challenging to know his rights prior to hiring a lawyer, even with the help of friends who are familiar with landlord-tenant law.Amber Cook, a tenant organizer in her own apartment building and an eviction court observer for Portland State University, which is conducting a large research project on eviction, said having the city council’s support of anti-harassment laws would give tenants more support in court.“My hope is that if the city stands up and says, ‘we’re against these forms of harassment and they are defined,’ it’ll give people more in their defense, and give the judges a little more push to take these laws seriously,” she said.—Jayati Ramakrishnan; jramakrishnan@oregonian.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Liz Weston: Remarried divorcee considers claiming ex’s survivor benefit,By Liz Weston ,Business,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|Liz Weston, personal finance columnistNEW!By Liz Weston Dear Liz: I was told by Social Security that because I remarried at 60, I could still collect half of my ex’s benefits once he died. He has just died, and half of his benefit is greater than my own retirement benefit. My current husband has not started benefits. If I collect half of my ex’s benefit but want to later switch to collecting benefits on my current husband’s record (once he starts to collect) or to survivor benefits should he die before I do, can I do that?Answer: The short answer is yes, although you’ve confused divorced spousal benefits with divorced survivor benefits.While your ex was alive, you might have been eligible for a divorced spousal benefit if you had remained unmarried. That benefit would have been up to 50% of your ex’s primary insurance amount (the amount he would receive at his full retirement age).The rules changed once your ex died. As a divorced survivor who remarried after age 60, you are entitled to up to 100% of what your ex was receiving. The survivor benefit will be reduced if you haven’t yet reached your full retirement age (which is currently between age 66 and 67).Survivor benefits also offer more flexibility to switch later than other types of benefits. If you choose to begin receiving a surviving divorced spouse’s benefit now, you can switch to your own benefit at any point through age 70, if your benefit is higher, says William Meyer, founder of the Social Security Solutions claiming strategies site. You also can switch to receiving spousal benefits from your current spouse’s record once he starts collecting, if that benefit is greater than what you’re receiving from your former spouse’s record.Figuring out the right way to claim can be tricky, so consider consulting an advisor or using claiming strategy software to determine what’s best in your situation.Liz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for NerdWallet.

Latest Oregon Measure 114 developments: What is the status of challenges to new gun limits?,By The Oregonian/OregonLive.com,Politics,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:23 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:35 a.m.|,None,|A controversial provision of Oregon Ballot Measure 114 is its ban on high capacity magazines.Jacob Hamilton file photo || For MLive.comNEW!By The Oregonian/OregonLive.comUpdate: The Attorney General of Oregon acknowledged late Sunday the state isn’t ready to have a permitting process in place as required by the voter-approved gun control Measure 114.Oregon’s strict new gun control limits will go into effect Thursday as things currently stand. However, that could change as early as Monday.A federal judge last week heard arguments on the first court challenge to Oregon Measure 114. After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled Dec. 8.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Background check backlogMeantime, Oregon State Police announced that any background check not resolved by Thursday would be held in place until a prospective gun buyer completed the permit requirement put in place by Measure 114. Then, OSP said, the background check process would resume.As of Saturday, Oregon State Police had 42,000 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.OSP's Update on the status of Firearms Instant Check System transactions in the Pended/Delayed Queue as it relates to BM114 - Oregonhttps://t.co/ybYwDa2Nlq pic.twitter.com/QUhT8PrVio— Oregon State Police (@ORStatePolice) December 2, 2022

Increased salesStores like Cabela’s in Tualatin are reporting more gun sales than usual.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” said store manager Richard Dziedzic. The store can handle about 80 people a day for gun sales. He said there was a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m. and the queue was full for the day by the time the store opened at 9 a.m.Permit systemIf the measure becomes state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Thursday. Marshall represented Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, whose office is defending the measure’s constitutionality.The courtroom’s public gallery erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.Update: The state says permits system will not be ready in timeMany law enforcement authorities have said they are working diligently on a system but do not see any way to have fully operational before the law’s enactment date. Additionally, they say the permit system will take resources away from other policing functions.On Friday, the heads of the Oregon police chiefs and sheriffs associations said their agencies are unprepared and not staffed or funded to support a permitting program for prospective gun buyers as required under Measure 114.Jason Myers, a retired Marion County sheriff who is now executive director of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, and Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, submitted the statement in support of one of the four lawsuits pending.A new permit application is in “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.Current court challengesThe Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. That challenge was the subject of Friday’s hearing.Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association.A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday. The newly filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.High capacity ammoOne flashpoint is the measure’s ban on magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them in their homes or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for other recreational purposes such as hunting, as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect.Many Oregon sheriffs have said, if this provision becomes law, they would not place a high priority on enforcing it.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Cowlitz tribe’s gamble: Campaign to keep ilani casino rivals at bay raises questions,|By Jeff Manning || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Business,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:29 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,208,|The ilani Casino Resort near Ridgefield, Washington, on Wednesday.Dave Killen / The OregonianNEW!208sharesBy Jeff Manning || The Oregonian/OregonLiveSince 2016, the Cowlitz Indian Tribe has paid millions to a Portland consulting firm and its owners to protect its highly successful ilani Casino Resort from unwanted competition — namely other tribes looking to expand their gaming operations in Oregon.Ilani became the nearest casino to Portland when it opened in 2017 outside La Center, Washington, and it now boasts annual revenue of at least $300 million a year, according to one estimate.Gaming is vital to Northwest tribal economies and, in this case, access to the highly lucrative gambling market in Oregon’s population center was at stake.Cowlitz leaders turned to consultants Matthew Rossman and Bruce Studer and their company — best known for a nearly two-decade quest to build the state’s first private, non-tribal casino over the objections of tribes in Oregon. At the urging of an influential tribal leader, the late David Barnett, the tribe entered into a contract paying from $30,000 to $50,000 a month to R&S Strategy Group or its owners, Rossman and Studer.Editor's note
This story was produced through a collaboration between The Oregonian/OregonLive and Underscore News. A future installment will explore a lawsuit in Washington state that could upend tribal gaming and, experts say, threaten the U.S. government's recognition of tribal sovereignty.According to a copy of the agreement and records of tribal meetings, as well as interviews with Rossman, the tribe aimed to stave off competitors, particularly the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon.Gaming dollars have been transformative for some tribes, funding various social programs. Casinos also have made some players in the business extremely wealthy. And few pursued the tribal gaming motherlode as aggressively as Barnett, who died in May at age 61.Barnett’s father was a tribal chair who led the Cowlitz to securing federal recognition, and the younger Barnett played key roles in securing the tribe’s land and getting ilani built. He, too, was elected in 2020 as chair of the tribe’s general council, its top leadership post.Barnett brokered a series of agreements between the tribe and Rossman and Studer, or at times with their company, R&S Strategy Group. Documents outline the arrangement in broad strokes, saying they would work to protect the ilani from competitors without specifying how.The agreements included a clause that forbade the would-be casino developers from moving forward with a private casino that would compete with ilani. And if the pair did develop a casino, the Cowlitz tribe would have the option to manage it for them.Thousands lined up for the grand opening of the ilani Casino Resort on April 24, 2017.Stephanie Yao Long/The Oregonian (file)Rossman told The Oregonian/OregonLive that Barnett wanted to expand the Cowlitz tribe’s gambling operations into Oregon. He said the contract gave the Cowlitz tribe first right of refusal to run any casino Rossman and Studer developed if their campaign was successful.“The goal was for the tribe to have a presence in Oregon,” Rossman said. “The majority owner would have been the Cowlitz, or Dave (Barnett).” Rossman added that the consulting agreements were reviewed and approved by outside law firms.Barnett worked zealously to advance the tribe’s gaming interests — though attorneys hired by the tribe warned his own interests were too closely intertwined, according to tribal documents. They also said Barnett promoted a culture of fear within the tribe. The tribe’s attorneys wrote in a 2021 report that Barnett had threatened members with lawsuits, violence or banishment.The Cowlitz declined to talk to The Oregonian/OregonLive about the agreement and the tribe’s goals.However, Cowlitz leaders and their attorneys have privately raised numerous questions about the deal, according to tribal records obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive.Some questioned why the tribe was paying so much and what it was getting in return.While declining to comment further, Cowlitz officials said the tribe had severed ties with Rossman and Studer.“The tribe has a duty to review and evaluate its contracts when issues are raised,” the tribe said in a statement. “Following that review, a decision was made to end the contractual agreement with R&S.”Orlando Moreno, a former manager of the Cowlitz tribe and an enrolled member of the Arizona-based Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, said he objected to the contract when he first joined the Washington tribe’s administration in 2020. The Cowlitz seemed to be getting little of value, he said. More broadly, the notion of one tribe launching a secret effort to undercut others offended him.“We have an unwritten agreement,” Moreno said. “At the end of the day, we’re all Indian Country. We support each other.”Contentious backdropCowlitz tribal leaders’ moves are playing out against the backdrop of significant changes in tribal gaming in Oregon.Increasingly, tribes in Oregon are challenging the status quo, particularly the policy set out by recent governors that tribes can only operate one casino located on their respective reservations. The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, operator of the Chinook Winds casino in Lincoln City, is pushing hard for permission to open a second casino in Salem. The Coquille Indian Tribe on Oregon’s south coast wants to build a casino in Medford.The Grand Ronde, which operates the Spirit Mountain Casino & Lodge, said it has no interest in expanding and remains an advocate of current state policy — one casino per tribe on their respective reservations, said Justin Martin, a Grand Ronde tribal member and its lobbyist in Salem.The Grand Ronde publicly opposed the ilani project. In 2010, it filed an ultimately unsuccessful appeal of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s decision to approve it, claiming that the casino was located outside traditional Cowlitz territory and arguing that the tribe was not federally recognized in 1934, a key test under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. A federal appeals court, however, found the tribe was nonetheless “under federal jurisdiction.”People play slot machines on the gaming floor of the ilani Casino Resort on the day it opened, Monday, April 24, 2017Stephanie Yao Long/The Oregonian (file)Grand Ronde officials were surprised when informed of the Cowlitz’s efforts that appeared to be aimed at the Oregon tribe.“It’s obviously disappointing and absolutely the opposite of the open and transparent policy we strive for,” Martin said. “Whether or not it’s legal, it’s just smarmy.”Tribes, forcibly relocated onto reservations, have closely guarded their legal franchise on casino gambling to fund health clinics, childcare centers and other services. Some give proceeds to tribal members in what is called a per-capita distribution.The nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon have organized against efforts to legalize private, non-tribal gaming in the state, including ballot initiatives led by Rossman and Studer.The duo has tried at least four times since 2005 to get voter approval to amend the constitution to allow private casinos. They managed to get their initiative on the ballot in both 2010 and 2012 and lost by wide margins in both. They scuttled a 2020 effort due to the pandemic.Travis Boersma, the billionaire co-founder of Dutch Bros Coffee, sought this year to open a casino-like gambling hall at a horse track in Grants Pass over objections from tribes. Boersma argued the operation was exempt because it was tied to racing, but shuttered the whole operation when the state denied a key operating permit.And there are nationwide threats to gaming as an economic tool for tribes. A case before a federal court in Washington state challenges the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which sets out a procedure for regulating gaming on Indian land. If the challengers succeed, they could open the door to private, non-tribal casinos nationwide — and weaken the very underpinnings of tribal sovereignty.Barnett’s visionBarnett went to high school in the blue-collar logging town of Aberdeen, Washington. He was a gifted distance runner — he never lost a race in four years — and got a scholarship to compete at the University of Washington. He eventually found his niche as a real estate developer.He kept his eye on the ultimate prize — a tribal casino.Indeed, ilani has been a watershed for the 5,000-member Cowlitz tribe, which claims ancestral lands that stretch from the Cowlitz River south to the Columbia. As recently as 2000, the tribe — which declined to sign treaties with the U.S. government in 1855 — was not federally recognized and had no reservation.Barnett’s father played an important role in the effort to secure federal recognition. The son was determined the tribe should take the next logical step – construction of a casino. Even Barnett’s staunchest critics give him credit for making ilani happen. He sold the land to the tribe where the Casino now stands. But Barnett also stood to benefit from the casino financially.David Barnett, a leader of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, laid the groundwork for what would become its ilani Casino Resort near La Center, Washington. He was photographed in 2004 as the tribe unveiled its plans.Joel Davis/The Oregonian (file)In 2004, years before the Cowlitz tribe had formally reclaimed any of its ancestral lands, Barnett’s company, Salishan Co., entered into a development agreement to build the resort casino that would become ilani in partnership with the powerful Mohegan Tribe, an experienced operator based in Connecticut. (Salishan Co. has no relation to Salishan Resort on the Oregon coast.)According to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed by the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, a publicly traded arm of the tribe, ownership of the company that would control and operate the casino was split three ways — nearly half to a Mohegan company, 40% to Barnett’s company, and the balance, 10.85%, to the Cowlitz tribe.By the spring of 2017, ilani was on the verge of opening its doors. But there was a last-minute snag. The National Indian Gaming Commission informed the Cowlitz and Mohegan that it wouldn’t approve the ilani management agreement because of concerns over Barnett’s conduct, according to SEC filings and a 2020 lawsuit the Mohegan filed against Barnett’s Salishan Co.It’s unclear what conduct the commission was concerned about.But Barnett could be erratic and aggressive, not hesitating to verbally abuse other members of the Cowlitz tribal government. Audio and video of a tribal gaming commission meeting in 2016 captured his profanity-laced tirades directed at tribal members who opposed him.He had brushes with law enforcement, including a 2009 incident in which he suffered a traumatic brain injury after he was thrown from the back of a pickup truck driven by his then-girlfriend.The woman told deputies she was attempting to flee in Barnett’s truck after an argument. Barnett, from the moving vehicle’s open truck bed, was attempting to break through the back window when he fell out onto the pavement.Barnett wasn’t charged with a crime, but three weeks after the crash, he told deputies that if they had tested his blood they likely would have detected alcohol and drugs, according to a police report.Barnett would continue to fight substance abuse issues off and on for the rest of his life. After his death last May, the cause was widely reported as a heart attack. It was actually “acute fentanyl intoxication,” according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.“It became apparent that issues in Mr. Barnett’s personal background would likely render him, along with any entity in which he held an interest, unsuitable for involvement in the management of the ilani casino,” the Mohegan said in its 2020 lawsuit filed against Barnett’s Salishan Co.Ultimately, Mohegan bought out the share owned by Barnett’s Salishan Co. On April 17, 2017, Mohegan agreed to pay $114.8 million over several years.Details of the buyout were included in the 2020 lawsuit as the Mohegan casino operators sought to pause payments to Barnett’s company during the pandemic, which had temporarily shut down the casino. The two sides settled the lawsuit in August 2020. The terms were not disclosed.Controversial strategyBarnett’s proposal to bring on R&S Strategy Group was controversial from the start.Documentation and audio from a 2016 meeting of the Cowlitz Tribal Gaming Authority make plain that members worried about the public relations black eye they could suffer if the agreement leaked. They also thought the consultants were asking too high a price for their lobbying work.“I think the Oregon tribes are going to come together and fight this,” said authority board member Carolyn Medeiros. “And the $30,000 a month is stupid.”Adding to their qualms was the fact that Barnett had already paid $30,000 out of his own pocket. Now he was urging the tribe’s gaming commission members to adopt the contract itself, assume the monthly payments and repay his expense.Barnett raged against dissenters, according to the audio, and heaped praise on R&S for its political savvy.“They work with a lot of legislators,” Barnett said. “They’ve got connections. They’re not nobodies. … You should be thanking me for getting us in front of this thing.”Barnett wanted the council to act fast, saying he worried Rossman and Studer had approached the Grand Ronde. Barnett warned gaming board members that Rossman and Studer could sign a deal with the Grand Ronde if the Cowlitz didn’t hire them.The Spirit Mountain Casino in Grand Ronde, operated by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, was the closest to the Portland metro area before the Cowlitz Indian Tribe opened its ilani Casino Resort in southwest Washington. Cowlitz tribal leaders hired Oregon consultants who had campaigned to overturn the state's prohibition of non-tribal casinos to protect their investment from competition, including from Grand Ronde and other tribes.Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian (file)Martin, the Grand Ronde lobbyist, confirmed that Rossman and Studer did approach the Grand Ronde about consulting. He said his tribe was not interested.Barnett prevailed, and the Cowlitz tribe signed an agreement with R&S Strategy Group in late 2016.According to tribal documents and a copy of the contract, the tribe agreed to pay $30,000 a month for 36 months followed by a $500,000 balloon payment at the contract’s expiration.In November 2020, the tribe entered into another memorandum of understanding with Rossman and Studer personally. This time, the contract called for the tribe to pay $50,000 a month over 42 months.It’s not totally clear what the Cowlitz Tribe got in return. The intervening years brought no major changes in Oregon’s tribal gaming landscape. Rossman declined to get into specifics but said the tribe got its money’s worth. Studer did not respond to questions.But concerns among tribal leaders grew, coming to a head at an Oct. 24 meeting of the Cowlitz Tribal Council. According to the council member who spoke to The Oregonian/OregonLive, those concerns included whether the tribe’s efforts could violate federal laws against blocking competition.Four attorneys from Orrick, a prominent national law firm, attended the meeting, according to an attendance list provided to The Oregonian/OregonLive. Among them were two antitrust specialists from the firm’s offices in Washington, D.C., and Houston, and a Seattle-based white-collar crime specialist.It’s unclear why the tribe would consult antitrust attorneys. Under the Sherman Act, antitrust laws are intended to curtail business arrangements that would fix prices or reduce competition on grounds these arrangements are generally bad for consumers.But the Sherman Act generally comes into play when competitors conspire to divvy up a market or fix prices — and no other tribe was involved in the Cowlitz deal.Rossman and Studer, whose agreement with the tribe instigated the debate, don’t operate a casino. Their campaign to change Oregon state laws remains a longshot bid.“Working to keep a competitor out of the market is fundamentally anticompetitive,” said Dan McCuaig, a private practice attorney in Washington, D.C., who spent nearly a dozen years prosecuting antitrust cases for the U.S. Department of Justice. “But if the other company in the agreement isn’t really a competitor, there’s no antitrust case.”Asked about those issues, Cowlitz officials again declined to comment. Rossman also declined to address that specific issue.The late October meeting was not the first time concerns were raised about the relationship with the consultants. The law firm Quarles & Brady advised the tribe in a 2021 written report that Barnett’s conduct in awarding the consulting contract with R&S Strategy Group should be investigated internally.“To be clear, there is no evidence that Barnett committed any federal criminal offenses,” the Quarles & Brady report states. “However, the alleged facts surrounding his dealings with R&S, his dual roles on tribal council and in development projects, and the federal funding the tribe receives raises serious concerns that warrant further investigation or disclosure to federal authorities.”It’s unclear whether the tribe pursued those concerns.Tribal leadership issued a memo to members in recent days advising them not to discuss or disclose tribal matters publicly.But several tribal members and former employees told The Oregonian/OregonLive that they hoped speaking up would end what they called a culture of bullying and fear.“Tribal leadership has forgotten where we came from. This is not our way,” said Robin Ladue, a 68-year-old retired psychologist and tribal member. “This is about honesty and integrity.”-- Jeff Manning; jmanning@oregonian.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Oregon Measure 114 means long lines at gun stores as judge considers challenge,|By Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 11:40 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 6:01 p.m.|,218,|The queue to purchase or pick up firearms at the Tualatin Cabela's filled up by 9 a.m. Saturday as Oregonians rush to purchase guns before Measure 114 goes into effect.NEW!218sharesBy Austin De Dios || The Oregonian/OregonLiveWith Measure 114 scheduled to go into effect Dec. 8, Oregonians attempting to buy guns are experiencing crowded lines and days long waits for background checks as the state sees a surge in purchases.As part of Oregon’s existing laws, anyone buying a gun in the state must pass a background check handled by the Oregon State Police. The surge in gun sales has created a backlog of 42,000 pending background checks, according to spokesperson Kyle Kennedy.The Cabela’s in Tualatin has implemented a queue system to handle the demand. Shoppers looking to buy or pick up a gun from the store scan a QR code to be placed in a waiting queue.The queue can only hold 70 to 80 people a day, and with a line of 50 people at the door by 5 a.m., it filled up by the time the store opened Saturday, according to store manager Richard Dziedzic. It can take all day to get through the list.“Volume has pushed up tremendously,” Dziedric said.Dziedric said Cabela’s has tried its best to help every customer, but the bottleneck in background checks has forced them to turn some people away.Customers at the Portland Sportsman’s Warehouse also lined the store Saturday – many holding a small slip of paper indicating their spot in line to pick up or purchase a firearm. Some had been waiting upwards of an hour.Jason Bray, one of the dozens at Sportsman’s Warehouse picking up a firearm, was there for a hunting rifle he ordered online. He said the changing gun regulations didn’t influence his rifle purchase, but that he had ordered some magazines for another gun ahead of Measure 114, which will ban the sale and transfer of magazines with more than 10 rounds.In addition to limiting magazine capacity, the measure will require a permit to purchase a gun in the state.“There’s kind of a frenzy here,” Bray said. “But, personally, I think it’s a waste of time. The only way to fix the problem is to repeal 114.”Controversy over the new gun regulations continued Friday in a federal hearing on whether Measure 114′s regulations are constitutional. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said that she will issue a ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled.– Austin De Dios; adedios@oregonian.com; (503) 319-9744Our journalism needs your support.

Oregon Measure 114 gun control challenge heard in court,|By Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 10:23 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 3:30 p.m.|,|1,213|,|State police announced Friday that the state's initial permitting process to buy a gun will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards due to the short window the agency has to put new law in place.APNEW!1,213sharesBy Maxine Bernstein || The Oregonian/OregonLiveA federal judge Friday heard sharply contrasting arguments about whether gun control Measure 114′s regulations are constitutional in what she described as a very complicated case amid a new legal landscape.After a two-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said she’ll issue a written ruling early next week on whether to grant a temporary restraining order or allow the measure to take effect as scheduled next Thursday.If the measure is allowed to become state law, Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall told the judge, Oregonians will be able to apply for a permit to purchase a gun on Dec. 8.The courtroom’s public gallery immediately erupted with laughter at Marshall’s pledge, as many gun rights advocates have been skeptical that the state police or local sheriffs can have a functioning system in place in such a short period of time.The voter-approved measure, which narrowly passed with 50.7% of the vote, will ban the sale, transfer and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; require a permit to purchase a gun; and ban gun sales or transfers without a completed background check.Marshall said Oregon will join 12 other states that already ban large-capacity magazines.Read text of the state of Oregon’s defense of Measure 114“We will become the 13th. I don’t think there’s a really good reason we should be the only ones to be enjoined,” he said, in response to the critics call for a temporary restraining order to be followed by a preliminary injunction.The proponents of the measure, a grassroots interfaith group Lift Every Voice Oregon, drafted it to reduce mass shootings, homicides and suicides. Blocking the ban on large-capacity magazines would create a significant risk of a “single individual killing large numbers of people,” Marshall said.“These are not useful for self-defense. They’re extremely dangerous,” he said.The Oregon Firearms Federation, three county sheriffs and two gun store owners from Keizer and Pendleton filed the first challenge to the broad measure last week. Two other suits followed soon after, one from the Bellevue, Wash.-based Second Amendment Foundation and another by the Oregon State Shooting Association, the state’s affiliate of the National Rifle Association. A fourth suit brought by the Sportsman’s Warehouse Inc. and a Yamhill County gun owner landed by the end of Friday.Read the text of the first legal challenge to Measure 114Most of Friday’s legal arguments centered on the ban on magazine capacity.Immergut asked lawyers who have sued the state to explain what evidence backed up their argument that magazines with more than 10 rounds are commonly used in self-defense.She also sought to find out whether they believe the court has any authority to regulate any gun or any type of ammunition, including body armor-piercing bullets or machine guns.The judge further pressed to understand whether she can factor current usage of large-capacity magazines in her decision.If a magazine with a certain number of rounds that seems innocuous but has been used “in a way that perhaps wasn’t contemplated,” such as in mass shootings, can the magazine then be considered dangerous and unusual, she asked.Attorney John Kaempf, on behalf of the firearms federation, three sheriffs and two gun store owners, and attorney WIlliam Bergstrom, representing the Second Amendment Federation, argued that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are prolific nationwide and have been commonly used for self-defense by law-abiding citizens since the 18th century.“Under Bruen, it’s a new day,” Kaempf argued, referring to the landmark ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June, which struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home.In the high court’s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the 6-3 majority directed lower courts to use a new “text-and-history” standard when evaluating challenges to firearms regulations. Courts must determine whether “the Second Amendment’s plain text” protects the conduct in which the plaintiff wishes to engage and, if it does, then decide if the regulation “is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”Kaempf argued that there’s a presumptive right to bear arms and that the Supreme Court ruling this summer made it clear that government can’t restrict the use of weapons that are in common use. If magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are barred, it “would make Oregonians less safe,” he said, adding that law-abiding people would be hamstrung “when ambushed in the dark.”“We just want you to preserve the status quo -- the way it’s been for decades,” he said. “One second of 114 going into effect on Dec. 8 , and we have irreparable injury.”He told the judge it’s not up to her to weigh or balance current societal concerns.“I have great respect for Your Honor. And what Bruen is telling you is it’s not up to you,” he said, pointing at the judge. “We already had balancing. It happened in 1791 when we passed the Second Amendment. The balancing (test) is over.”Immergut noted that the Supreme Court ruling, though, made it clear that its decision is not a “regulatory strait jacket” and allows a variety of gun regulations.Marshall, of the attorney general’s office, argued that large-capacity magazines have entered U.S. commerce only in recent years, citing statistics that they made up 1% of firearm use in 1955 and, by 1995, 7% of use.He also urged the court to consider an analysis done by Lucy P. Allen, an economic consultant who studied the NRA’s Armed Citizen database of shootings from January 2011 through May 2017. Allen found that it was extraordinarily rare for a person, when using guns in self-defense, to fire more than 10 rounds. Allen found that armed defenders fired 2.2 rounds on average.Bergstrom, representing the Second Amendment Foundation, argued that the Supreme Court’s guidance in the New York case restricts regulations of anything but “dangerous and unusual arms.” He said magazines of more than 10 rounds have not proven to be unusual or dangerous.In fact, he said, Americans have owned as many as half a billion of these magazines.Kevin Starrett, head of the Oregon Firearms Federation, submitted a declaration, writing that “perhaps a majority” of all guns sold in the United States come from the factory with magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, and rifles with magazines that hold up to 30 rounds.Even if the magazines are common now, the judge asked, what’s the evidence these larger-capacity magazines are commonly used for self-defense. She further questioned if there’s a point where a certain number of rounds in a magazine would make it dangerous.“There may well be. ... It’s well above 10,” Bergstrom responded. He pointed to a 2021 National Firearms Survey that found guns with magazines that carry more than 10 rounds are most commonly used for recreational target shooting, home defense, hunting and defense outside the home.The judge confirmed that Measure 114 doesn’t restrict anyone from having multiple magazines that hold up to 10 rounds, and that larger-capacity magazines can still be used on the shooting range, in shooting competitions on private property or for recreational purposes, such as hunting.“You would agree that law enforcement conceivably should have weapons that are different than a private citizen should have. Wouldn’t you?” Immergut asked Kaempf.“No,” Kaempf responded. “I don’t see a historical tradition of that.”Though much of the discussion centered on the measure’s restriction on gun magazines, Kaempf also argued that the measure’s new permit requirement to buy a gun “now puts a presumption of guilt” on the applicant who will have to prove to a “permit agent” why they’re “good enough” to get a permit.“Are you saying background checks aren’t constitutional?” the judge questioned. No, Kaempf said.Several members of Lift Every Voice Oregon, including chief petitioner Marilyn Keller, attended the hearing. Union County Sheriff Cody Bowen, who joined with the firearms federation to try to block the measure, and Klamath County Sheriff Chris Kaber, not involved in any of the lawsuits, were among those who also attended the hearing.“I’m frustrated we’re here to begin with,” Bowen said afterward, adding that he thinks the focus shouldn’t be on guns but on increasing Oregon’s mental health and addiction services. He said he still doubts the state will be ready to put the measure into effect, contending the state police computer systems aren’t even compatible with some local sheriff and police systems and current background checks for gun sales are significantly backed up.As of Friday, Oregon State Police had 41,160 background checks pending for gun purchases or transfers, Capt. Kyle Kennedy said. On Black Friday, the state police received 6,055 new background check requests, the highest amount since Election Day, he said.Any checks that aren’t completed by midnight Wednesday will be put on hold, and will await the purchaser’s proof of a new permit to buy a gun, state police said Friday. Once that is obtained, the firearms background check will resume.A new permit application is in the “final review” with local police and sheriffs agencies, and is expected to be posted to the state police website on Thursday, the state police announced.But the initial permitting process will be a “manual paper process,” including a return to the use of paper fingerprint cards. State police don’t have “Livescan machines,” that many local police and sheriff’s agencies own to scan fingerprints.“With BM114 becoming law on December 8, 2022, this gives Oregon State Police a very short window to develop a program and have technology available for use on day 1 of the new law. Because of this, the Permit-to-Purchase program at Oregon State Police will be a manual paper process until new technical systems can be designed and implemented,” a state police statement said. “OSP does not have the ability to update the Livescan software. We are researching a solution.”Late Friday, the newly-filed Sportsmen’s Warehouse suit took aim mainly at Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase requirement. It urges the court to bar the measure from going into effect “unless or until the permit system is up and running.” If the state lacks a system to implement it, it will become a “defacto ban’' on firearms sales in Oregon, its attorney James Buchal wrote in the suit.Kaber, sheriff of Klamath County, said he came to court Friday to support his colleagues. Whichever way the judge rules, he said, he’ll do everything he can to make sure “law-abiding people” in his county can obtain guns through the permit system, if necessary, though he doesn’t support it.To obtain a temporary restraining order, the plaintiffs suing the state must show that gun rights advocates will suffer immediate “irreparable injury” if the measure is allowed to take effect. Such an order is usually a stopgap step that lasts until the court can review more substantial evidence on whether to grant a permanent injunction.Later Friday, the Springfield Police Department issued a statement, saying it won’t be ready to accept permits to purchase guns if the measure takes effect on Thursday, but said it’s continuing to work with other agencies to adopt a permitting program. The police department also alerted the public that changes in staffing to support a permitting program will impact its other services if no additional staffing is provided.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

|Intel, cutting costs, offers unpaid leave to factory workers worldwide|,|By Mike Rogoway || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Oregon Tech,None,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 1:48 p.m.|,146,|Workers in white bunnysuits and glasses move through an Intel clean room in Hillsboro. NEW!146sharesBy Mike Rogoway || The Oregonian/OregonLiveIntel is offering thousands of manufacturing employees three months of unpaid leave, another effort to trim its budget amid a historic sales decline.“Retaining our manufacturing talent is a key element of positioning Intel for long-term growth,” Intel said in a written statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive. “Voluntary time off programs allow us an opportunity to reduce short term costs and offer employees attractive time off options.”The Financial Times reported Friday that the program was available to factory workers in Ireland. Intel said the same program is available at its facilities worldwide, including in the U.S. The company declined to say whether employees retain benefits while on leave.Intel is Oregon’s largest corporate employer, with 22,000 people assigned to its manufacturing, research and administrative campuses in Washington County. The company also has factories in Arizona, New Mexico, Ireland and Israel, with additional assembly and test sites in China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Costa Rica.Intel told employees in October to expect layoffs and leaner budgets as it sought $3 billion in savings next year, and billions more in coming years.The chipmaker’s third-quarter sales were down 20% from a year earlier amid a precipitous decline in the PC market and reduced demand from data centers. The slowdown comes at a particularly inopportune time, as Intel has committed to spend $80 billion to beef up engineering and build new factories in Arizona, Ohio and Germany.There’s growing optimism within the industry that the chip market could begin recovering next year, though, and there’s broad agreement that long-term demand for semiconductors will be robust.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has built his turnaround plan on revitalizing the company’s manufacturing prowess, so the unpaid leave may represent Intel’s effort to manage the current downturn without doing permanent damage to its factory network.-- Mike Rogoway || mrogoway@oregonian.com || 503-294-7699 || Twitter: @rogoway ||Our journalism needs your support.

|Oregon Ducks to hire UTSA’s Will Stein as offensive coordinator, per source|,|By James Crepea || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Ducks,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:59 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:47 p.m.|,None,|NEW!By James Crepea || The Oregonian/OregonLiveOregon has found its new offensive coordinator.The Ducks are set to hire UTSA’s Will Stein as their next offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.Stein has spent the past three seasons with the Roadrunners, including as serving as co-offensive coordinator and QB coach this season. UTSA is in the top 20 nationally in several categories, including pass efficiency (162.67, 7th), third-down (49.7%, 8th), total offense (486.1 yards per game, 9th), scoring (38.7 points, 12th) and passing (308.6 ypg., 12th) and red zone (90.2%, 17th).Quarterback Frank Harris is third nationally in completion percentage (71.1%) with 3,865 yards with 31 touchdowns and seven interceptions and 588 rushing yards and nine scores. The Roadrunners also have 1,100-yard receiver Zakhari Franklin, who has 14 touchdowns, Joshua Cephus (87 receptions for 985 yards and six touchdowns) and De’Corian Clark (51 catches for 741 yards and eight scores).In 2021, those three receivers combined to catch 204 passes for 2,585 yards and 25 touchdowns and made UTSA one of only three teams (Appalachian State, Ohio State) to have three receivers with at least 50 receptions and 750 yards.Stein, 33, spent 2020-21 as passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach at UTSA. He served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Texas powerhouse Lake Travis High School in 2018-19, where he coached four-star 2020 recruit Hudson Card, who signed with Texas. Card entered the transfer portal on Monday.On3 first reported the hire of Stein, who played quarterback at Louisville — also his hometown — from 2008-12 for coaches Steve Kragthorpe (2008-09) and Charlie Strong (2010-12). He worked under Strong as a graduate assistant working with quarterbacks at his alma mater in 2013, then under Bobby Petrino in a quality control position at Louisville in 2014. Stein reunited with Strong in the same capacity at Texas in 2015-17.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

|Carolina Panthers waive struggling quarterback Baker Mayfield, a former No. 1 pick|,|By Steve Reed, The Associated Press|,NFL,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 11:01 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 10:44 a.m.|,None,|The Carolina Panthers waived quarterback Baker Mayfield Monday. (AP Photo/Rusty Jones)APNEW!By Steve Reed, The Associated PressThe short-lived Baker Mayfield era is over in Carolina.The Panthers waived the struggling quarterback on Monday after the 2018 No. 1 draft pick asked for his release. Mayfield would be subject to waivers and become a free agent if he goes unclaimed.The move does not come as a surprise, because Sam Darnold replaced Mayfield after his failed second stint as starting quarterback, and the Panthers like what they have in backup P.J. Walker. The move gives Mayfield a chance to potentially land with a team that needs quarterback help.San Francisco’s Jimmy Garoppolo, Jacksonville’s Trevor Lawrence and Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson all suffered injuries over the weekend.Panthers interim coach Steve Wilks said Mayfield asked for his release once he informed the quarterbacks that Darnold would be the team’s starter and Walker would be the backup this Sunday at Seattle.“Baker has been nothing but a professional since he’s been here, a complete pro,” Wilks said. “I have tremendous respect for him.”Wilks said he made the decision to go with Walker over Mayfield as the backup after “looking at the body of work the last couple of weeks. I felt P.J. has been productive when he was in there.”Mayfield was 1-5 as Carolina’s starting QB and completed just 57.8% of his passes, having six touchdowns and six interceptions. He also struggled with tipped passes at the line of scrimmage. The Panthers are last in the league in third-down conversions.Wilks said he couldn’t pinpoint why Mayfield didn’t work out in Carolina.“I can’t answer that question,” Wilks said. “It is so many different reasons. I wouldn’t say that he failed. I would say that it just didn’t work out. He is still a good football player. Just like coaches and just like players, sometimes they need a change.”Panthers general manager Scott Fitterer traded for Mayfield earlier this season after unsuccessfully trying to acquire Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans, and he beat out Darnold for the starting job in training camp. Darnold later injured his ankle and landed on injured reserve and only recently returned to action.Carolina will send the Cleveland Browns a fifth-round pick in 2024 as compensation.Fitterer was not made available to reporters on Monday.“I have nothing negative to say about Baker,” Panthers running back D’Onta Foreman said. “I think he handled the situation the right way. Even with his ups and downs you never saw him act different or have a mood change. He was always the same guy. So I respect him and wish the best for him.”Guard Austin Corbett said Mayfield stopped by the offensive line meeting room to inform them that he’d been released before leaving Bank of America Stadium, thanking them and telling them he loved them.Corbett said he expects Mayfield to land with another team and doesn’t blame the QB for asking for his release, given he wouldn’t have been activated on game day.“When you’re the number three (quarterback), why not go try to be number two somewhere?” Corbett said. “We saw quarterbacks getting banged up all day Sunday and hopefully he lands in a good situation.”Corbett had been teammates with Mayfield in Cleveland, and he said the move was a reminder to him about how temporary tenures are in the NFL.“This business strikes again, just being the worst thing ever to make friends in and make connections in,” Corbett said. “I love Baker and love his family. He and his wife, Emily, they are just two great people, wholesome people. This business sucks. It’s tough. He will get picked up no doubt and we will see him down the road.”-- Steve Reed, Associated Press Sports WriterIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

(AP Photo/Marco Garcia)APNEW!By Doug Feinberg, The Associated PressStanford coach Tara VanDerveer stands atop The Associated Press women’s basketball poll with the most appearances all time, breaking a tie with the late Pat Summitt.VanDerveer’s Cardinal remained No. 2 behind top-ranked South Carolina on Monday, giving her 619 weeks with one of her teams in the AP Top 25: 592 weeks with Stanford and 27 with Ohio State when she was in charge of that program. Summitt’s 618 weeks in the poll all came with Tennessee.The Hall of Fame coach downplayed the achievement.“Fortunate to be here for 36 years. We have great players and have been successful,” VanDerveer said. “I don’t pay attention to (records). People bring it up and I’m like ‘OK, great.’”Louisville fell out of the Top 25 for the first time since 2016, a span of 127 weeks. That was the fifth longest active streak. The Cardinals (5-4) started the season ranked seventh and have struggled to find consistency this year, dropping their last two games to Ohio State and Middle Tennessee.They are the third preseason top 10 team to fall out of the poll, joining Texas (this week) and Tennessee (last week). Before this year, only 10 preseason top 10 teams had fallen out of the rankings at some point during the year since the AP Top 25 became a writers’ poll in 1994-95.Even more rare has been a preseason top five school dropping out. Only five teams had done that prior to this year and none before January. Tennessee was the last to do it, starting the 2015-16 season at No. 4 before falling out of the rankings Feb. 22.Now Texas and Tennessee are both out before the New Year.“Two factors are at play here. One of them is more parity with more good teams,” said Rebecca Lobo, the former UConn star, ESPN analyst and Top 25 voter. “The other factor at play is the transfer portal. I think those three teams all have multiple players who start who weren’t in their program a year ago. It’s a reflection that you can’t just assemble teams and right away expect them to be good. I think all those teams will in the poll by the end of the season.”Ohio State moved up to No. 3 after, the Buckeyes’ best ranking since Nov. 30, 2009, when they also were third. Indiana and Notre Dame round out the top five.UConn fell three spots to sixth with Virginia Tech seventh, the best ranking ever for the school. North Carolina and N.C. State were tied in eighth and Iowa State is 10th.RANKED RAZORBACKSArkansas (10-0) vaulted into the poll at No. 21. The Razorbacks have a difficult month ahead with games against No. 18 Creighton and a tournament in San Diego that has Oregon, South Florida and Ohio State.“I do think we know a lot about our team,” Arkansas coach Mike Neighbors said.He was also happy his team made the poll as every sports team on campus that has played this year has been ranked, including football, men’s basketball, soccer and cross country.“We didn’t want to be the team that stops that streak,” he said..FALLING LOUISVILLEThe Cardinals had been ranked ever week since Jan. 11, 2016. That was the same season they started the year at No. 8 before falling out on Nov. 30, the earliest a top 10 team had fallen out of the poll until last week. Things got better for Louisville as the Cardinals finished that regular season 24-6 and went 15-1 in the ACC.HISTORIC WEEKWith Louisville, Texas and Tennessee all out of the Top 25, it marks only the second time in the poll’s history that none of those three teams were ranked. The only other time was the first-ever poll in 1976.COMING AND GOINGOklahoma and Kansas State also returned to the Top 25 this week, coming in at No. 23 and No. 24.

Preseason No. 1 North Carolina drops out of AP men’s basketball top 25,|By Aaron Beard || The Associated Press|,College Basketball,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 10:14 a.m.|,None,|Marcus Sasser and the Houston Cougars sit atop the AP men's basketball poll for the second consecutive week. (Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images)Getty ImagesNEW!By Aaron Beard || The Associated PressHouston and Texas remain firmly entrenched atop The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll, while preseason No. 1 North Carolina has dropped out entirely after a fourth straight loss.The Cougars earned 37 of 62 first-place votes in Monday’s poll, extending the program’s first stay at No. 1 since the “Phi Slama Jama” days in the 1980s for another week. Houston (8-0) beat Norfolk State and Saint Mary’s in its first week at the top.“I don’t dwell on it,” coach Kelvin Sampson said last week about the No. 1 ranking. “We’re not running around here pushing our chest out, thinking we’re something we’re not.”The Longhorns received 14 first-place votes. No. 3 Virginia got three votes and No. 4 Purdue got the remaining eight.Connecticut (9-0) climbed to No. 5, the program’s highest ranking since early in the 2011-12 season. Other than the top five, there are three other teams in the AP Top 25 that entered Monday undefeated (No. 11 Auburn, No. 13 Maryland and No. 23 Mississippi State).SWIFT FALLNorth Carolina is only the sixth team to go from preseason No. 1 to unranked since at least the 1961-62 season, most recently with Michigan State during the 2019-20 season.Of that group, the Tar Heels had the swiftest exit from the poll to start the season (four weeks) excet for UCLA in 1965-66. The Bruins fell out of the poll after just three weeks back when only 10 teams were ranked.Ranked No. 18 last week, the Tar Heels (5-4) l ost their fourth straight game over the weekend at Virginia Tech while playing without banged-up big man Armando Bacot. They appeared on a single ballot this week from the 62-member panel that votes on the AP Top 25.“I told them also that I’m not panicked, I’m not any of that,” coach Hubert Davis said afterward. “I’m convinced we’re going to be a great basketball team by the end of the season.”Last year’s Tar Heels were on the bubble to even make the NCAA Tournament well into February in Davis’ debut season. They went on a final-month tear all the way to the NCAA championship game before falling to Kansas.THE TOP TIERKansas climbed to No. 6, followed by three Southeastern Conference teams in Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. For the Volunteers and Crimson Tide, it marked their first appearances inside the top 10 this year. Arizona rounded out the top 10, falling six spots after a loss at Utah.RISINGNo. 13 Maryland had the biggest jump of the week, vaulting nine spots after wins against Louisville and Illinois last week in the Terrapins’ first year under Kevin Willard. That marks the program’s highest ranking since pushing into the top 10 during the 2019-20 season.Tennessee was next up with a six-spot climb, while No. 11 Auburn rose four spots.In all, 13 teams climbed from last week.SLIDINGCreighton had the week’s biggest fall, tumbling 14 spots to No. 21 after losing at Texas and at home to Nebraska last week.No. 12 Baylor fell six spots after a loss to Marquette, though the Bears responded by beating Gonzaga on Friday in a rematch of the 2021 NCAA championship game won by Baylor.The Zags, now No. 18, fell four spots to their lowest ranking since checking in at No. 20 on Christmas Day in 2017.In all, four teams slid from last week.STATUS QUOBeyond the top three, No. 25 Ohio State remained in place after a tough loss at No. 15 Duke last week.WELCOMENo. 23 Mississippi State and No. 24 TCU were the new additions to the poll, with the Bulldogs (8-0) earning their first AP Top 25 ranking under first-year coach Chris Jans since January 2019.The Horned Frogs were ranked 14th and 15th, respectively, in the first two polls before falling out for two weeks.FAREWELL (FOR NOW)In addition to UNC, Michigan State (No. 20) fell out after losses to Notre Dame and Northwestern.CONFERENCE WATCHThe SEC led the way with six ranked teams, including No. 16 Kentucky. The Big Ten and Big 12 each had five ranked teams, followed by two each for the Atlantic Coast, Pac-12 and Big East conferences.The American Athletic, West Coast and Mountain West conferences each had one.AP Top 251.

Portland Timbers sign Brazilian midfielder Evander in club-record transfer,|By Ryan Clarke || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Timbers,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:54 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:00 a.m.|,111,|Midtjylland's Evander, right, challenges for the ball with Feyenoord's Marcos Lopez during the Europa League Group F soccer match between Feyenoord and Midtjylland at De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Thursday, Oct. 13, 2022. (AP Photo/Patrick Post)NEW!111sharesBy Ryan Clarke || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe Portland Timbers have added a star in the midfield who could provide a significant boost to the team’s attack.Brazilian midfielder Evander da Silva Ferreira — known simply as Evander — signed with the Timbers Monday from Danish side FC Midtjylland. His arrival, which has been anticipated for months, comes with a club-record transfer fee of roughly $10 million, a team source told The Oregonian/OregonLive.Evander, 24, will occupy a designated player slot for Portland and awaits word on his physical, International Transfer Certificate (ITC) and P-1 visa to enter the United States and join the club. His contract runs through 2026 and includes a club option for 2027.A team source told The Oregonian/OregonLive that Evander and midfielder Yimmi Chara will be the Timbers’ designated players in 2023, with midfielder Sebastian Blanco and forward Jaroslaw Niezgoda’s salaries no longer meeting the threshold for designated player status.“We are thrilled to announce the acquisition and signing of our new Designated Player, Evander,” Timbers technical director Ned Grabavoy said in a release. “It was clear from the beginning stages of this process that this was a great opportunity for both Evander and the Portland Timbers. He is a player with natural ability, capable of making an impact, and has already proven himself at a good standard. We see him as an integral part of the club’s future and look forward to seeing him in Green and Gold soon.”Evander spent five seasons with Midtjylland in the Danish Superliga, scoring 50 goals and notching 38 assists in 167 appearances. He featured in UEFA Champions League and Europa League contests, leading the 2022 Europa League in assists with five in six matches.Prior to Midtjylland, Evander played three professional seasons in his birthplace, Rio de Janeiro, for Brazilian club Vasco da Gama. Evander has yet to appear for a stacked Brazilian senior national team, which is currently in contention for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but he has made several appearances for the country’s youth national teams.Evander projects in a central, attacking midfield role for the Timbers under head coach Giovanni Savarese, and will provide Portland a much-needed injection of technical skill, goal-scoring prowess and precision passing.“We are extremely excited to welcome Evander to Portland,” Savarese said in the release. “He has proven consistently in the Danish Superliga that he has the quality to be a game changer. His experience in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League allows us to believe that he will be able to adapt quickly to the MLS competition. I am looking forward to incorporate Evander and start working with him to build a stronger team for the next season.”-- Ryan Clarke, rclarke@oregonian.com, Twitter: @RyanTClarkeIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Pastificio d’Oro is your favorite pasta cook’s favorite pasta restaurant,|By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Dining Out,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:52 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 9:04 a.m.|,None,|37Pastificio d’OroNEW!By Michael Russell || The Oregonian/OregonLiveEditor’s note: This week and next, we’re counting down our favorite new Portland restaurants of 2022, starting with our No. 10: Pastificio d’Oro, a pint-sized St Johns neighborhood pasta restaurant where almost everything is made from scratch.Casting back to summer, some of my fondest memories involve sitting with friends on the wobbly picnic tables outside this St. Johns pasta spot, the sun’s last rays disappearing behind The Wishing Well’s neon palm tree just down the street.At the time, Pastificio d’Oro was still a promising pop-up at Gracie’s Apizza. On Mondays and Tuesdays, former Jacqueline chef Chase Dopson would make pasta entirely by hand while painter Maggie Irwin took orders, poured wine and tossed farm-fresh salads with her signature honey-sweet dressing.The restaurant, which took over the pizzeria space full time last month, remains a true Mom-and-Pop, only one where, according to Dopson, everything but the bread, wine, Parm and charcuterie are made from scratch.“Yeah, but I do slice that,” Irwin points out.Along with Gracie’s, it’s also the latest restaurant bringing a little heat to St. Johns, a North Portland neighborhood where the dive bars might be better known than the restaurants.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com || Instagram || YouTube || Facebook || Twitter || TikTokBut what makes Pastificio d’Oro unique is Dopson’s commitment to making his pasta entirely by hand. That means mixing up balls of golden dough by hand, then rolling each into a billowing sheet using a mattarello, or long wooden rolling pin. It’s a time-intensive method more familiar to Italian nonnas than typical American restaurants, where even the fresh pasta is typically flattened by machine.Dopson started making pasta after he was laid off at the start of the pandemic, reading cookbooks, watching videos and buying an imported mattarello from Evan Funke, the pasta evangelist whose new Los Angeles restaurant Mother Wolf is almost as hard to get into as Portland’s Kann. Like many chefs, he was drawn to the pastas of the Emilia-Romagna region.“It’s so diverse for such a small region, but it’s also so luxurious,” Dopson says. “It’s rustic but rich, gluttonous but so fun to eat. Think of a lasagna Bolognese: It’s so over the top but just so delicious.”After initially launching a meal kit service at Jacqueline, Dopson’s pasta caught the eye of Craig Melillo, the owner of Gracie’s Apizza, where Irwin had previously worked. In 2021, Melillo reached out to the couple about using the pizzeria on Monday nights, when he was typically closed. The first Pastificio d’Oro’s pop-up took place that September.As The Oregonian/OregonLive first reported, Gracie’s Apizza is in the process of moving to a new location with room for a larger oven just a few blocks east. With construction underway, the two businesses have switched roles: Pastificio d’Oro now operates on weekend nights, Gracie’s Apizza pops up on some Mondays and Tuesdays.Visit from Thursday to Sunday now, and you’ll find Dopson’s pastas — some squash-stuffed tortelli, perhaps, or a tagliatelle al ragu — bowls of that zippy salad and plates of aged prosciutto. A rustic tart or sugar-dusted cake rounds out a menu kept blessedly small.Like Funke, Dopson sometimes cooks his pastas a few seconds short of al dente, a level of doneness some will prefer more than others. (The late Los Angeles Times critic Jonathan Gold found Funke’s style distracting enough to leave his blockbuster Santa Monica restaurant, Felix, off his last restaurant guide; I also like a more supple texture, but didn’t find it disqualifying here or at Felix.)And the pleasures of Pastificio d’Oro go beyond pasta. There’s a small wine list, plus good Negronis and other cocktails courtesy of The Garrison, the bar next door. You might find platters of puffy Italian frybread served with a pear-plum mostarda. And though the sun dips below the horizon before Pastificio d’Oro opens these days, it remains a fantastic place to meet friends for dinner, perhaps followed by a movie at the St. Johns Twin across the street.What to order: With a group of two or more, it would be borderline irresponsible not to order the whole menu.Details: After launching as a Monday pop-up, Pastificio d’Oro switched to Thursday-Sunday dinner hours in November; 8737 N.

|For this Oregon actor and vocal coach, music is much more than sound|,|By Tom Hallman Jr. || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Life & Culture,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:30 a.m.|,None,|9Tiara HerrNEW!By Tom Hallman Jr. || The Oregonian/OregonLiveOver a cup of coffee, Tiara Herr rolls up her sleeves to reveal two tattoos. One features five flowers representing the number of times cancer nearly killed her. The other tattoo – 14188 – is her hospital patient number.Given what she’s experienced in life – “I have lived with a dark cloud” -- it would be natural to expect that Herr would be most at ease in the shadows. Instead, she loves being on center stage in front of an audience.To describe what she does with her artistic gift diminishes what she has accomplished, ignoring the obstacles. To focus only on her struggles, though, diminishes what Herr shares with audiences and fellow performers.Is Herr a good singer and vocal coach? Or is she a good singer and vocal coach for someone who has experienced profound hearing loss?“I’ve come to realize that damn near everyone I meet seems to believe that the ability to sing or play music well is a quality that simply cannot be possessed by individuals who are hard-of-hearing or deaf,” said Herr, who was drawn to the theater and performing while a student at Banks High School.“When I was in my 20s,” she said, “a director told me no one would ever hire me because the audience would be unable to understand what I was saying because of what he called my deaf accent.”Herr, 30, grew up in Timber, a small town in unincorporated Washington County. After graduating from high school, she went to Pacific University in Forest Grove, where she earned bachelor’s degrees in music and biology.Now, she is a research assistant at The Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, part of Oregon Health & Science University. Herr works with a team in Beaverton studying viral disease threats using multiple lasers to analyze and characterize the immunological make-up of every cell in a sample stained with fluorescent antibodies.She also plays piano, sings, acts, directs and serves as a vocal coach with Theatre in the Grove, a community theater in Forest Grove.When Tiara was a high school junior, her older sister, Trinity, learned the theater was holding auditions for a musical. The sisters, a cousin and friends all tried out and were cast.“Tiara can hear musical things I don’t hear that need fixing,” said Ken Centers, who has called on Herr as a vocal director for past productions he’s directed. “But then, when we’re talking, there are moments when she says she can’t hear me.”Herr reads lips and occasionally uses hearing aids but has not found a pair that helps with her form of hearing loss. She does not use them when she sings, acts or works with other singers.Herr is currently involved in the Dec. 2-18 production of “World War II Radio Christmas” by Portland playwright Pat Kruis Tellinghusen. The play is set in 1940s Portland and features songs and stories inspired by the experiences of real veterans. Herr is not only in the cast of three women, five men and three children, but she also wrote the music for the commercial jingles used in the production.Herr said she learned how to sing by focusing on how her tongue felt in her mouth rather than by hearing and repeating notes and phrases.“I don’t really understand it,” said Centers. “The best thing I can say is that she’s an enigma.”***Tiara Herr claps to thank her family and friends for support at Pacific University's undergraduate commencement ceremony May 17, 2014.Laura Frazier/The Oregonian/2014Part of the mystery is why Herr is even alive. When she was 13 months old, surgeons removed a cancerous tumor from the adrenal gland on top of a kidney. Months later, Herr’s mother felt more lumps. Herr returned to the Portland hospital. Surgeons removed the cancerous tumors, and the girl was given a good prognosis, her mother said.“When she was 3, she started complaining,” said her mother, Donna Herr. “She said her fishbones hurt, and she pointed to her ribs.”Another trip to the hospital revealed a large cancerous tumor had attached to her liver, displacing the little girl’s pancreas and spleen. The tumor was removed. The doctor suspected more cancerous nodules on her leg and told Herr’s mother the child had high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops throughout the body in nerve cells.“We were told she had a 20% chance of survival,” said Donna Herr. “We called St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis because they specialize in childhood cancer.”The Herrs were told they’d have to pay their way to St. Jude’s. If, after an exam, Tiara was accepted as a patient, the hospital would pick up all future medical and travel costs. They didn’t have the money to make the initial trip. St. Jude’s officials eventually called Donna Herr to say that parents of a St. Jude’s child who had died of neuroblastoma learned of Tiara’s situation and offered to pay for airline tickets and lodging to bring the Oregon girl to the hospital.“I truly believe there was a higher power at work,” said Donna Herr. “When we got there, they did all their tests and found Tiara had a tumor at the bottom of her spine. We were told that when she started treatment, she was going to lose some or all her hearing because of the extensive and intensive chemotherapy.”Donna Herr said drugs needed to fight that form of cancer destroyed her daughter’s inner eardrums, causing her to lose nearly all her hearing within six months.For the next eight years, Tiara Herr traveled to St. Jude’s for treatments. By the end of the journey, surgeons had removed 40 tumors. She underwent a bone marrow transplant, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and intense radiation treatments. Though she could no longer hear the way she had in the past, she never lost her love of music.“While I was sick with cancer and going through a plethora of treatments, my mother and father would encourage me to sing to help me get through,” she said. “This led to me singing at the top of my little lungs while skipping through the hospital in my frilly Easter dresses when I was feeling better. I truly believe that my family fostered a talent I was born with and never let me think for one second that I couldn’t sing just because I was hard of hearing.”***Tattoos on Tiara Herr’s forearm feature five flowers representing the number of times cancer nearly killed her, and the number 14188, her hospital patient number.Jamie Hale/The OregonianTiara Herr learned to love music from her father, George Andrew Herr, who died in 2012 from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.“He sang each morning,” she said. “That’s how he woke us up. He was a lovely tenor. On the way to school, we listened to music in the car, and he sang along with Barry Manilow.”Despite her hearing loss, Tiara taught her herself how to play the family piano and sing. Herr said she hears what she calls “the shape” of a sound. Because she had perfect hearing until she was 6, she said she can remember chords, notes and musical phrases.“I have profound bilateral hearing loss referred to as sensorineural hearing loss,” said Herr. “I can hear almost normal at low pitches, but as the frequency increases, my ability to hear drops off to literally nothing. I am about 90% deaf. I cannot hear fire alarms or birds singing, the latter of which makes me incredibly sad as people say the singing of birds is so beautiful.”In college, Herr studied voice and piano, was in a choir and joined singers from Pacific University who performed in Taiwan.“I think I was born into a family that always had music playing and were singing to me,” said Herr. “But part of it has always been this mysterious thing. Once I lost the biggest section of my hearing, it’s like my other senses magically found a way to make it possible for me to sing and play along with everyone else.”When pressed to explain “mystery,” Herr turns to music theory and history.“I can even recognize pitches that I can’t hear by feeling the vibration and transposing it down to an octave I can hear in my head,” she said. “I got the idea from Beethoven, actually. As he lost his hearing, he started to lay his head on the piano to be able to identify and ‘hear’ his compositions using his sense of touch, sight, and musical intuition. This is basically what I do.”Herr brings that experience and background to Theatre in the Grove.“She’s an inspiration to everyone she works with,” said Jennifer Grimes, who performs in Theatre in the Grove productions, including last summer’s “Mamma Mia.” “She does it with grace and optimism and confidence you wouldn’t expect if you knew her story.”Grimes said watching Herr work as vocal director of “Mamma Mia” was “phenomenal.”“There were 40 of us, and she could tell who was singing the right notes, who needed work,” said Grimes. “She worked out all the harmonies. I don’t know how she does it.”Earlier this year, Herr returned to St. Jude’s to participate in a study on the long-term effects of cancer and treatment on children. She took her hearing aids to help researchers evaluate her.“I played the grand piano in the cafeteria every single day,” she said. “I was surprised how many children noticed that I was wearing the same hearing aids and hospital bracelet as them and were shocked that I could sing and play. I really hope that I can be a role model for children everywhere and let them know that they not only can beat their cancer, but also grow up to be a musician even if they wear hearing aids.”Herr does not believe that music must be reduced to notes and chords written on a page.“Music is so much more than sound,” she said. “Music is emotion. Music is intuitive. Music is natural. Everything is musical and resides in the souls of us all.”— Tom Hallman Jr. 503-221-8224; thallman@oregonian.com; @thallmanjrThis article is supported by PacificSource, a partner of Here is Oregon.

|Take a cozy, car-free family mini-vacation to Cannon Beach|,|By Lizzy Acker || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Travel & Outdoors,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 8:41 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|Nona and her grandparents and Haystack Rock.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianNEW!By Lizzy Acker || The Oregonian/OregonLiveConsider the TikTok travel influencer, jetting to Europe and Asia, having glamorous adventures on sleeper buses and speed trains, backpacks at the ready, vistas everywhere.Now, consider this: You can pack a bag and walk out your door, today even, and have your own glamorous transit-filled adventure in a dreamy location, no plane required.Cannon Beach is an adorable oceanside village, adjacent to what is arguably Oregon’s biggest Instagram star: Haystack Rock. And a very nice bus will take you there, from Portland, Beaverton and Hillsboro, twice a day.On a recent late fall day, I left my house before dawn with a backpack and a three-year-old in a collapsable stroller, and we set off on our sweet little journey.HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com || Instagram || YouTube || Facebook || Twitter || TikTokFirst: Trimet.Riding on public transit is one of the true benefits of living in a city. In Portland and the surrounding area, for $2.50, you can travel pretty much anywhere. Is it perfect? No. Is it an amazing resource that is available to everyone? Yes.So, we walked (or strolled, depending) to our nearest bus stop. Because it was a Sunday, and, with a three-year-old, you have to give yourself a little padding if you want to be on time anywhere, we were 23 minutes early, which meant we walked a few stops and watched the sunrise.I am sure someone, somewhere will say that the time constraints presented by transit make it impossible to do with kids, but, counterpoint, those constraints add to the fun – a trip on transit has parameters, which narrow down the possibilities and forces you to make choices and a plan before you go. There’s no getting on the road late, with kids screaming from car seats, feeling stressed and harried. You just … leave early to make sure you are on time. No stress. And kids, almost across the board, love a bus.Nona on Trimet.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianAt least, my kid, Nona, loves a bus. She was happy to climb on and ride downtown, and even happier when her grandparents (my parents) got on some stops later.You could do this trip with one adult per child, but I find the vacations are more fun when the ratio of adults to kids increases. Also, my parents are experts at public transit and I like hanging out with them.Together, the four of us disembarked from the city bus downtown and then walked through Old Town to Union Station. Again, we were a little early, but that meant extra time to walk around the train station and get hot beverages for the adults.The NorthWest route on the Point bus goes from Portland to Astoria with five stops along the coast. The bus itself is a nice coach, with comfy seats and a small bathroom. The ride takes less than two hours and unlike a car ride, takes zero years off your life.Purchase tickets for the bus through Amtrak.Nona played with some toys, got a few snuggles in and availed herself of the bus bathroom.The view of Haystack Rock from Hallmark Resort and Spa.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianWhen we got to Cannon Beach, we got off the bus and headed to the Hallmark Resort and Spa (1400 S. Hemlock St.). I picked the Hallmark because it’s out of tsunami territory, up high on a bluff, across from Haystack Rock, with beach access. (”Wow,” Nona said, when she saw the view.)They also serve warm cookies at check-in, which I failed to note started at 4 p.m.Since it was not yet 11 a.m., we got on a list for early check-in, dropped some bags and walked down Hemlock Street, the Cannon Beach main drag, in search of food.Lunch at Ecola Seafood Restaurant & Market.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianWe opted for fish and chips and clam chowder on the rooftop at Ecola Seafood Restaurant & Market (208 N. Spruce St.). The day was sunny and surprisingly warm and both the salmon and halibut were crispy on the outside and sliding apart inside, everything fish and chips should be. The clam chowder was also good and the toasted, buttery garlic bread reminded me of Mo’s in my childhood in the best possible way.The food isn’t cheap – $26 for a four-piece halibut fish and chips – but there isn’t much cheap food to be found in Cannon Beach or anywhere, at this point.After lunch, we strolled over to Bruce’s Candy Kitchen (256 N. Hemlock St.), an outrageous explosion of sugar that was a high point for the youngest member of our party. We purchased several things, including a pumpkin-shaped chocolate that she happily munched for the next quarter of an hour while we took turns pushing the stroller on the hard sand on the beach.The glory of Bruce’s Candy KitchenLizzy Acker/The OregonianOur room wasn’t ready yet, so we stopped in at Bald Eagle Coffee House (1064 S. Hemlock St.), a utilitarian but sweet little coffee shop connected to an art gallery. The woman behind the counter was absolutely lovely, making a “tepid” vanilla steamer for the youngest, decaf coffee for the oldests, and a black tea for me.The weather continued to be the star of the show – a sunny day on the Oregon Coast is better than a million-dollar lottery jackpot win – and we sat outside, watching the foot traffic on Hemlock Street.After a quick spin through Cannon Beach Book Company (130 N. Hemlock St.), the hotel called and said our room was ready. So back up Hemlock we walked.Our room at the Hallmark was cozy and inviting, with a huge comfy bed, a gas fireplace and a little side window view of the beach. But we didn’t hang out for long. Instead we donned swimsuits and headed to the indoor pool.Hot tub and pool at Hallmark Resort and Spa.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianThe Hallmark has a main pool, with a little one-foot deep side pool “for little kids,” as Nona noted. They also have two hot tubs (one hotter and away from the main pool) and an adults-only sauna.We went back and forth between hot tubs and the pool, enjoying the cornucopia of watery options.After the pool, we dried off and put on clean clothes to walk down the beach for dinner.Cannon Beach is epically walkable, and who really wants a car when you walk from many hotels down a world-class beach to the downtown area, where most of the food is located?Lizzy and Nona on the beach.Lynda BishopSo we walked down the beach, occasionally carrying the three-year-old, and then turned in to walk to Driftwood Restaurant & Lounge (179 N. Hemlock St.).The Driftwood has a gorgeous patio, but unfortunately, minors aren’t allowed. No matter. The inside is full of wood and (electric) candles and vibes. The restaurant is 75 years old and it’s the kind of place your grandpa would love, but so would you.My parents split shrimp Louis, Nona had a grilled cheese, and I opted for the prime rib and prawns special. All the food earned high marks. My prime rib was truly rare, tender and delicious, especially with the horseradish sauce. The Pete’s Mountain pinot noir from West Linn was a great addition, though such a huge glass I couldn’t finish it. The cocktails that my parents tried – a ginger mule and an old fashioned – were strong but tasty.Prime rib and prawns at Driftwood Restaurant & Lounge.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianAfter dinner, we walked back to the hotel along the beach in the dark. There was almost no moon and only two campfires on the beach. Haystack Rock was still visible, black against the sky, and stars and planets were twinkling.We snuggled in the cozy bed, fire on, and watched a little hotel TV (another highlight for Nona), before falling asleep.In the morning, Nona took a bath in the jacuzzi tub in my parents’ room while I walked down another dark, empty beach to Cannon Beach Bakery (240 N. Hemlock St.) to get some breakfast.The pastry case at Cannon Beach Bakery.Lizzy Acker/The OregonianI picked a blueberry muffin, a chocolate muffin, a slice of pumpkin bread and a marionberry scone, all of which were enjoyed by the crowd back at the hotel.We didn’t have too much time to lollygag since the bus picks up in Cannon Beach again at 9:20 a.m. So we checked out and headed to another coffee shop for more pastries because you should always have something for the road. Sleepy Monk Coffee Roasters (1235 S. Hemlock St. A).There are many things to recommend the Sleepy Monk – it’s located right next to the stop where the Point bus picks up, it has great seating outside looking out at Hemlock, the coffee is good (according to my parents), the vanilla steamer is good (according to my daughter) and the orange chocolate scone is very good (according to me).Before long, we were on the bus again, snacking and napping, and then back in Portland, on Trimet and home. A genuinely relaxing and lovely trip, all made possible by the fact that I didn’t have to spend one second driving.Family photo.Lizzy Acker/The Oregonian— Lizzy Acker503-221-8052; lacker@oregonian.com; @lizzzyackerOur journalism needs your support.

This Swedish silver spoon tells a family story. What is it worth? ,|By Jerry L. Dobesh || For The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Homes & Gardens,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 6:08 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Jerry L. Dobesh || For The Oregonian/OregonLiveTreasured family heirlooms and interesting antique shop finds are among the pieces our collectors have inquired about this month. We’re looking at a silver spoon and pressed glass set with family histories. The value of such family mementos is often far more sentimental than intrinsic. Additionally, this month’s inquiries widely range from an ornate pair of opera glasses to a kitchen clock from a middle-class home and a pair of 19th-century cast iron bench sides.Silver tablespoonThis family heirloom was made by Bengt Tornberg of Linköping, Sweden.Courtesy of the collectorThis silver spoon has been given to the oldest daughter in my family for the last several generations. My grandfather’s family was from Sweden. It is 9 inches long and has an engraved inscription. I would love to know the age and if it is from Sweden. – C.H., BeavertonYour table spoon is indeed Swedish. The marks identify it as being made by Bengt Tornberg of Linköping, Sweden. The “A4″ stamp is the date code, which dates your spoon to 1831. The engraved inscription translates to “For long term and faithful service,” and the terminal (the end farthest from the bowl) is engraved with the initials “IH” and “MCL.” Your spoon was likely a gift to a maid or house servant. Likely the receiver was “IH,” and the giver was “MCL.” It’s possible that research in Sweden could help you identify both parties, if that might interest your family. At an auction, you might see an estimate of $30-$50 for such a spoon. Dealers specializing in antique continental silver may ask $100 - $150 for Swedish silver spoons of similar age, size, and quality in excellent condition.Oak clockThis “kitchen clock” was made by the Waterbury Clock Company of Waterbury, Connecticut.Courtesy of the collectorWe bought this oak shelf clock in a Troutdale antique shop several years ago. It runs well. It is 23 inches tall. What can you tell me about it? – J.B., VancouverYour clock is known as a “kitchen clock” and was made by the Waterbury Clock Company of Waterbury, Connecticut, and likely dates to 1880-1900. Waterbury made clocks from 1837 to 1944, when it was renamed the United States Time Corporation. As you know, your clock is key wound and is an eight-day movement. The small wheel at the center of the dial is an alarm that can be set. The case is of pressed oak. This type of clock with a decorative pressed wood case is often referred to as a “gingerbread clock,” as they were often seen used in Victorian-era homes, which often had ornate exterior decoration, such as one might add to a gingerbread house. While it is of the same period, the pendulum of your clock is likely by the New Haven Clock Company. The dial on this pendulum can be adjusted in one-minute-a-day increments to keep it running accurately. At an auction, you might see an estimate of $50-$100 for this type of clock. An antique clock dealer may ask $200-$300 for this type of clock if running and in excellent, all-original condition.Opera glassesThese opera glasses are by the Laval Company of Paris.Courtesy of the collectorI have had this pair of French opera glasses for years. What can you tell me about them? They are 4 inches wide, and the case is 3 inches tall. – H.L., GreshamYour opera glasses are by the Laval Company of Paris and date to the second half of the 19th century. They appear to be of gilt brass construction. The eyepieces, adjusting wheel and covers of the barrels are nicely executed in mother of pearl. The case appears to be leather with a satin lining. At an auction, similar opera glasses have sold in the $75-$125 price range. Dealers specializing in antique decorative artworks might ask $300-$400, or even more, for such a pair of opera glasses if in excellent condition with clear optics.Set of Depression glassThese pieces are pressed (machine-molded) glass and are considered Depression glass.Courtesy of the collectorThese pieces are pressed (machine-molded) glass and are considered Depression glass.Courtesy of the collectorMy grandmother gave me this set of purple glass cups and saucers and a white creamer and sugar in the same pattern. She said they used them in the Depression. The cups are 3 inches high, the plate is 9 inches wide, and the cream and sugar are 4 ¼ inches high. I have four each of the cups, saucers, and plates. I’m curious about what they might be worth. – J.E., PortlandYour glasswares were made by the Hazel-Atlas Glass Company of Wheeling, West Virginia. They are pressed (machine-molded) glass and are considered Depression glass. They are in the “Newport” pattern, which collectors sometimes call the “Hairpin” pattern. Your cups and saucers are in the Hazel-Atlas “Amethyst” color and were made circa 1936-1940. Your creamer and sugar are of Hazel-Atlas “Platonite” glass, a white glass that is more translucent than milk glass. These pieces also likely date to circa 1936-1940, though they may have been made into the mid-1940s. At an auction, you might expect an estimate of $60-$100 for your group of glassware. If you were looking to replace these, dealers specializing in Depression glass often ask $15-$25 each for cups and saucer sets, $15-$30 each for dinner plates, and $20-$30 for creamer and sugars of the types you have. Therefore, readily replacing these might cost $140-$250, not including shipping costs if necessary.Cast iron bench sidesThese bench sides appear to date to the last quarter of the 19th century.Courtesy of the collectorI was given a pair of cast iron bench sides back in 1970. The original slats are long gone, as are several generations of replacements. I was getting a new set ready to mount and thought it might be fun to learn more about them. There are no foundry or maker’s marks to be seen on either side of either piece. I believe they were old already when they were given to me. I’m just curious as to their age and origins. – P.F., PortlandYour bench sides are likely English. Based on the quality of the casting, they appear to date to the last quarter of the 19th century. Antique cast iron is sought after, and you might see an auction estimate of $400-$600 for this pair of bench sides. If you can find a dealer selling just the bench sides, you might expect to see this type of pair priced at $900-$1,200. Dealers ask $3,500-$5,500, or even more, for cast iron garden benches in excellent condition, even fitted with new lumber.About Today’s CollectiblesThe values discussed for items featured in this column were researched by Portland appraiser Jerry L.

|Dear Doctor: What is follicular lymphoma, and do I need to treat it immediately?|,By Dr. Keith Roach,Health,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: I am an 86-year-old woman who was recently diagnosed with follicular lymphoma, stage 3A. It was discovered on a CAT scan when I went to the ER for diverticulitis. I have no symptoms. The doctor did a biopsy to confirm, and I had a PET scan as well. I feel good otherwise. I am only on blood pressure and cholesterol medications.My oncologist is recommending low-dose chemotherapy. I am conflicted. At my age, what should I do? -- L.H.ANSWER: There are many types of lymphomas, which are a type of cancer of blood cells, but unlike leukemias, lymphomas are predominantly in the lymph nodes. Follicular lymphoma is an “indolent” type of lymphoma, meaning it is very slow-growing, but unfortunately often uncurable. People with no symptoms from follicular lymphoma and who are stage 1, 2 or 3A tend to have a long time before they have progression of the disease to the point of having symptoms. Depending on other characteristics, that time ranges from an average of three years to an average of seven years. Choosing to hold off on treatment is definitely a reasonable option for a person in your situation.However, your oncologist knows much more about your disease than I do, such as the extent of tumor in the abdomen, the molecular markers of the tumor and additional blood results. When an oncologist suggests treatment, I would listen carefully. One treatment that your oncologist might be considering is immunological therapy, such as rituximab. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, rituximab alone is pretty nontoxic and can delay the progression of the disease. A large study suggested improvement in the quality of life with the rituximab. Usually, rituximab is given once a week for four doses, but some oncologists repeat the four doses every two months.If I had a patient in your situation, I would say holding off on treatment would be reasonable, given your age and lack of symptoms, but a trial of the rituximab (if that is what the oncologist is contemplating) would also be a reasonable choice. If you had serious side effects to the treatment, I would recommend against further doses.DEAR DR. ROACH: I recently read your column on astaxanthin. The article contained a statement that flabbergasted me. Can you explain the details behind it? You state: “Most astaxanthin sold commercially is synthesized from petroleum products.” What gives? -- K.O.K.ANSWER: Any drug, supplement or chemical you buy is either extracted and purified from a natural source or is synthesized in chemical reactions (or some combination of the two). For example, if you buy curcumin from the health food store, the supplement might start off as the roots of the shrub Curcuma longa in the ginger family. Then, these are boiled in water and baking soda and also powdered, making turmeric. Curcumin is purified from turmeric through the use of a solvent like acetone and crystalized to make pure curcumin.However, curcumin from the health food store might also be synthesized directly from vanillin, which, in turn, is derived from wood pulp or from crude oil. No matter whether the curcumin starts -- as turmeric roots from India, as wood pulp or as oil -- the chemical you take is exactly the same, and your body doesn’t know where it comes from.Keep in mind that the manufacturer chooses the least expensive way of getting you what you want.* * *Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

She’s rude and insulting and acts like she is better than everyone else. She feels she’s entitled to have family members watch her kids so she can do what she wants.

Ask Amy: Lying liars are going to lie. Wife needs to focus on her options,By Amy Dickinson,Advice,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 12:02 a.m.|,None,|Amy Dickinson writes the syndicated Ask Amy column.Tribune Content AgencyNEW!By Amy DickinsonDear Amy: I have been with my husband for 23 years. It took me many years to trust him, due to his past behavior where he lied to me and was with other women.Honestly, it took me over 20 years to finally trust him, but this was a mistake.Recently, he started acting suspiciously, again. In the past, I never looked in his phone, but this time I decided to look at his text messages. He was planning to take a single woman camping for a weekend. He’s known her for a while.She knows he is married. We had a huge fight. He said he told her that I said it was OK. What single middle-aged woman would think that any shade of this is OK?I tried to contact her by phone and text. She never responded.I made him leave for the weekend so that I could think about our relationship.I am angry, hurt and I feel betrayed.I destroyed every card and 99 percent of my pictures of the two of us.He says he doesn’t want a divorce. He says he wants me here with him.He is refusing counseling.Any suggestions?– Sad and EmptyDear Sad: You seem quite focused on what your husband says, and on what he claims to want.Given that you don’t trust him at all, you should not trust his lame explanations or dodging statements. Nor should you judge a single woman for agreeing to go camping with your married husband. Why? Because, given that he seems to be supplying the information here, there is some likelihood that she doesn’t know that he is married, or that he has told her that you two are separated or divorced.All of your information about your husband’s behavior comes from him.Over two decades of being with him should have taught you this: Lying liars lie. It’s what they do. Nor does your husband seem particularly interested in changing.Take the time you need to grieve this relationship, but it is also important that you focus on what you want and need from here on out. Life is short. You have an opportunity for a fresh start. Counseling will help you to clarify your options. Go to counseling without him.Dear Amy: I am known in my family for being a baker, and for the holidays I do love to make cookies, pies and pastries.I also love making special holiday bread.My husband recently reconnected with a relative with special dietary needs (no sugar and no gluten), and he wants me to bake additional items (a dessert and bread) for every holiday event they will be attending.While I’m not opposed to some alternative baking, I don’t really have the time (or the desire) to make multiple alternative recipes for each occasion.I don’t have any problem buying some items for them from the local gluten-free bakery to bring, and I would be happy to do that.Am I being unreasonable?– BakerDear Baker: If you are hosting an event in your home where you will be supplying all of the baked goodies, it would be thoughtful for you to include something that this relative can safely eat. Remember that anyone can eat no-sugar/no-gluten food, so perhaps you can find a recipe that is tasty and which everyone can safely consume, saving you the trouble of doubling up on your baking.If you are supplying all of the baked goods for an event outside your home, then yes – it is thoughtful for you to also bring something safe for this relative to eat. Homemade or store bought, who cares? It truly is the thought that counts.And speaking of thoughts – because this is so important to your thoughtful husband, perhaps he can take on some of the responsibility for supplying these specialty baked goods.Dear Amy: I was amused by your answer to “Clean Please!” the letter from a woman who was about to move into her boyfriend’s small and extremely messy apartment.You warned her about the red flags over this situation, where you really should have warned HIM! He’s the one who she will relentlessly try to change the second she moves in. He’s the one who will be cast as a “problem.” He’s the one who will be constantly disappointing her.– Disappointed GuyDear Disappointed: I assure you – if the letter had been written by the male partner in this situation, I would have warned him, for the reasons you state.You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

|Dear Annie: My husband says he’s working harder at being affectionate, but he still runs cold|,By Annie Lane,Advice,None,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 4:00 p.m.|,None,|Annie Lane writes the Dear Annie advice column.NEW!By Annie LaneDear Annie: My husband and I love each other very much, but we have grown apart for a while now. I’ve done my best to be a good and loving wife, yet it seems to be hard for him to give me physical affection. He says he loves me and doesn’t want to be without me, yet we physically seem to be 1,000 miles away.I try to be affectionate, but it seems like it’s “whatever” for him. I don’t feel connected to him and feel like we’re more just friends and partners. Over time, I have given up and don’t bother with being affectionate anymore. We have a young child together, and I don’t want to divorce. I’ve told him how I feel 100 times over the years, and he says that he’ll try in the future. But he never is able to give me what I need.He also asked why I can’t just accept him for him. I feel like that’s very selfish because I try to cater to his needs, but he wants me to just deal without something that is very important to me. I feel hurt and depressed about it. I told him that if that’s the case, we should focus on our child and that he should not expect anything emotional or physical from me. We agreed to be friends and partners, but he says he doesn’t want that. He wants us to grow close and for me to be his wife. He wants to be able to be sexual with me, too.I’m angry because it’s been the same song and dance for a long time with him saying this or acting like he’s going to be different. I end up getting disappointed, and on top of that, I feel like it’s disrespectful to be able to have sex with me without being affectionate. I understand people have their love language, but if his lack of affection and connection makes me deeply sad, along with us acting like we’re friends instead of husband and wife, then why can’t he suck it up and do what will make me happy with this one thing? I don’t find it unreasonable for someone to act like they love me instead of only saying it and then telling me they can’t live without me when I’m fed up. -- HopelessDear Hopeless: Be hopeful. People do change, especially when you both love each other but seem to be having different ways of expressing it. Perhaps you should both read the book “The Five Love Languages” by Gary Chapman so that you each get a better understanding of how your partner shows love and how they need to receive love. He seems to say that he wants to work on your marriage, so express to him that actions speak louder than words. That if his actions don’t change, it is just empty promises. But your actions have to change as well. You have to let go of the anger and frustration from the past and move forward. If you cannot do that, then it might be time to seek the help of a professional marriage counselor.Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.COPYRIGHT 2022 CREATORS.COMIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Online sleuths in stabbing deaths of 4 Idaho students seek answers to key questions,By The Associated Press,Public Safety,|Updated: Dec. 05, 2022, 6:28 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 7:40 a.m.|,None,|FILE - The moon rises on Nov. 29, 2022, as a Moscow police officer stands guard in his vehicle at the home where four University of Idaho students were found dead on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe deaths of four University of Idaho students nearly three weeks ago has riled up thousands of would-be armchair sleuths, many of whom are posting speculation and unfounded rumors about the fatal stabbings online.Relatively few details have been released in the horrific case that has left the small town of Moscow stunned and grieving for Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.The unanswered questions are fueling extensive interest in details about what happened. Here is a look at what is known about the killings, and what remains a mystery:IS THERE A SUSPECT?The Moscow Police Department has not yet named a suspect or made any arrests. Investigators have also not yet found a weapon, the department wrote in a news release Wednesday. Autopsies determined the four students were stabbed to death, likely with a fixed-blade knife, and investigators checked with local stores to see if any had sold military-style knives recently.FILE - People attending a vigil for the four University of Idaho students who were killed on Nov. 13, 2022, hold up their phones during a moment of silence on Nov. 30, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation.(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)APWHO WERE THE VICTIMS?All four were friends and members of the university’s Greek system. Xana Kernodle, 20, was a junior studying marketing. She was from Post Falls, Idaho, and joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority on campus. She lived at the rental home with the other two women who were stabbed, and she was dating Ethan Chapin, who was visiting the night of the killings.Chapin, also 20, was from Mount Vernon, Washington and was a triplet. His brother and sister also attend UI, and both Chapin and his brother were members of the Sigma Chi fraternity.Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were both 21 and friends who grew up together in northern Idaho. Mogen worked with Kernodle at a local Greek restaurant in Moscow. She was also a member of Pi Beta Phi.Goncalves was a senior majoring in general studies, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority and was planning a trip to Europe next year.WERE THE VICTIMS TARGETED?It’s unclear whether the killer or killers knew the victims. Police and the county prosecutor’s office have released confusing — and at times contradictory — statements about whether the victims were “targeted.”On Thursday, the police department issued this statement: “We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants.”Investigators say nothing appears to have been stolen from the home.WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT AND MORNING OF THE ATTACK?Goncalves and Mogen went to a local bar, stopped at a food truck and then caught a ride home with a private party around 1:56 a.m., according to a police timeline of the evening.Chapin and Kernodle were at the Sigma Chi house — just a short walk away — and returned to Kernodle’s house around 1:45 a.m., police said.Two other roommates who live in the home were also out that evening, but returned home by 1 a.m., police said. They didn’t wake up until later that morning.After they woke up, they called friends to come to the house because they believed one of the victims found on the second floor had passed out and wasn’t waking up. At 11:58 a.m., someone inside the home called 911, using a roommate’s cell phone. Multiple people talked with the dispatcher before police arrived.Police found two of the victims on the second floor of the three-story home, and two on the third floor. A dog was also at the home, unharmed.Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault, police said.HAS ANYONE BEEN CLEARED?Police say that neither the two surviving roommates nor anyone who was at the home during the 911 call are believed to be involved with the attack. Police also say some of the people seen out with Goncalves and Mogen, including the person who drove them home, are not believed to be involved.A sixth person is also listed on the rental lease for the house, police revealed Thursday, but detectives do not believe that person was at home during the attack.FILE - Officers investigate the deaths of four University of Idaho students at an apartment complex south of campus on Nov. 14, 2022, in Moscow, Idaho. It's been nearly three weeks since four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, but there are still more questions than answers surrounding the investigation. (Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP, File)APARE OTHER AGENCIES HELPING WITH THE INVESTIGATION?A lot of manpower and resources have been focused on the investigation. Idaho Gov. Brad Little has made $1 million in emergency funding available for the investigation.The Moscow Police Department has four detectives and dozens of officers on the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has assigned more than 40 agents, with about half stationed in Moscow. The Idaho State Police has roughly 20 investigators assisting, and several troopers patrolling the town.IS THERE ANY THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY?Police initially said there was no threat to the community, then later walked back that statement. Because the killer (or killers) is unknown, and because whether the attack was “targeted” is hazy, many in the community are fearful.The University of Idaho has allowed students to switch to fully remote learning, and Dean of Students Blaine Eckles said Wednesday that less than half of the students left campus in favor of online classes.The university has also hired an additional security firm to help with campus safety. Students can request escorts while on campus.DID ANY OF THE VICTIMS RAISE SECURITY CONCERNS BEFORE THE ATTACKS?Neither the university nor the police department have said whether any of the students reported unusual activity or expressed safety concerns in the months or weeks before the attack.The police department has looked into reports that Goncalves may have had a stalker, but despite pursuing hundreds of tips, has been unable to verify that claim, according to a " Frequently Asked Questions " document released by the department.WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE PERSON? OR SO-AND-SO?Rumors, speculation and unfounded theories abound online, many targeting people that police have already said aren’t involved in the crime.“There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,” the police department wrote in a Facebook post Thursday evening. “We encourage referencing official releases for accurate information and updated progress.”Police frequently hold back some information about criminal cases because releasing it could harm the investigation. Sometimes crucial evidence doesn’t become publicly known until after an arrest is made and the case goes to trial.Detectives are looking for tips, surveillance videos from the area and other information that could provide context about the killings. They are asking that people call or email the police department with tips and upload any digital media to a special FBI website.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Portland’s Jefferson High will preserve historic 1909 building in upcoming modernization,|By Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Education,|Updated: Dec. 02, 2022, 5:22 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 1:03 p.m.|,357,|Portland Public Schools board members will vote on a plan to modernize Jefferson High School, but preserve the school's historic 1909 core building.Photo by Eder Campuzano/StaffNEW!357sharesBy Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLiveFor two years, students, parents, educators and neighbors have mulled plans to renovate North Portland’s Jefferson High School, which serves the state’s highest concentration of Black high schoolers.Now, the final proposal for the extensive renovations, slated to begin in 2024, is coming into focus – but how much money it will cost is still a big question mark, especially given Portland Public Schools’ history of higher-than-predicted final costs on some previous school modernization projects.On Dec. 13, the school board will vote on a recommendation to completely renovate Jefferson’s existing building, which was built in 1909.A full teardown and rebuild had also been under consideration for the high school, à la the brand new Lincoln High School in Southwest Portland, which opened this fall at a cost of about $245 million, nearly $60 million more than the original estimate.But community feedback ran strongly in favor of preserving the historic building, a team from Bora and Lever, the architecture firms working on the project, told a school board subcommittee on operations and facilities earlier this week. The building has remained a landmark in the Black community even as the neighborhood around the school has gentrified, pricing out many Black families who have moved east of 82nd Avenue, said Chandra Robinson, an architect with Lever.“There’s been a recognition that the neighborhood has changed, it will continue to change. But the fact is that the overall form of the original 1909 building and the placement of buildings on the campus is what people understand to be part of the community,” Robinson said. “It was important for community members to be able to save something they had a memory of, and pass that to future generations and imagine people coming back to the neighborhood.”Enrollment in the district has been declining among elementary and middle schoolers, including those who would attend the newly completed Jefferson in 2028. That’s a trend driven by declining birth rates and rising home prices that began prior to COVID-19. That drop was then exacerbated by the pandemic, when some families moved, went to private school or started home-schooling during the district’s yearlong building closure. PPS lost about 4,200 students between fall 2019 and fall 2021, enough to fill three large high schools.When it reopens in 2028, Jefferson would have more than 200,000 square feet of usable space, which Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero noted this week will be “the most available square footage of any of our comprehensive high schools, [with] at least of today, the smallest enrollment.”The new Jefferson will have space for 1,700 students, the same as the district’s seven comprehensive high schools. But Jefferson is a magnet school that features a college-going culture and partnership with neighboring Portland Community College; students attend it only by choice, not by neighborhood assignment. Students who live in the surrounding neighborhoods are offered the chance to enroll at either Jefferson or one of three other high schools: McDaniel, Grant or Roosevelt, Currently, only about 600 are enrolled at Jefferson.Prior to its reopening, the board and district have suggested that there will be a reconsideration of those dual assignment enrollment boundaries. And they have also said they plan to reserve spots at the school for the children of Jefferson’s strong contingent of Black and other alumni, even those who no longer live in the district. That’s similar to an attendance-via-petition program available at Boise-Eliot elementary school, another school with deep ties to the Black community that sits in a gentrifying neighborhood.Jefferson will be the seventh of the district’s high schools to undergo renovations or a rebuild when construction begins in 2024. It’s expected to open in fall 2028, and students will remain onsite during the construction period. Cleveland High School, in Southeast Portland, and Ida B. Wells, in Southwest Portland, are the remaining schools that have yet to be refurbished.Plans call for a handful of new spaces, including a central courtyard, new gym facilities, a media center, and a performing arts wing, with a new theater and multiple dance studios. The school is home to the Jefferson Dancers, an elite troupe that draws students from across the city. The school’s well-loved blue track oval, a touchstone for neighbors, some of whom helped fundraise for its original construction, will remain intact.Construction costs for Jefferson will be covered by the district’s $1.2 billion bond, approved by voters in 2020, when the cost of the project then was estimated at $311 million. But the actual cost will be higher, given a huge jump in inflation-related construction costs over the last two years, Bora and LEVER architects say. The 2020 bond included $93 million set aside for potential cost escalation, which district officials say they can tap for Jefferson . The project’s architects say they will unveil an updated cost estimate when the full school board meets in mid-December.Meanwhile, plans to relocate Harriet Tubman Middle School, another school with historic ties to Portland’s Black community, remain up in the air. The school is currently located adjacent to Interstate 5, raising serious health concerns over air quality and in 2021, the Legislature set aside $120 million for a new middle school at a location yet to be determined.There had been talk of relocating Tubman to the Jefferson campus, but that’s essentially off the table now because of space constraints, according to school board member Julia Brim Edwards. One potential option is to co-locate it with Kairos charter school, which also serves a predominately Black student body and operates in the former Humboldt Elementary School, whose front door is a quarter-mile walk from Jefferson.That building has room for 510 students, an independent building assessment conducted in 2020 concluded, so it might need to be expanded to accommodate Tubman. Kairos currently enrolls 216 students, while Tubman has 379.District leaders say they hope to have landed on a firm location for Tubman by April and have it open by 2027, if all goes well. In the meantime, Tubman students would attend a so-called “swing site” school, potentially in the former Kenton Elementary School, which is four miles from the Tubman campus.—Julia Silverman, @jrlsilverman, jsilverman@oregonian.comIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|4 Idaho students were killed in ‘targeted attack,’ authorities say: ‘We’re going to solve this’|,By Tribune News Service,Pacific Northwest,|Updated: Dec. 02, 2022, 3:21 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 11:11 a.m.|,None,|Flowers, a stuffed animal, and a framed image featuring the photos of the four people found dead at a house on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho, rest in the snow in front of the house on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)APNEW!By Tribune News ServiceFollowing back-and-forth claims from law enforcement on the fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students last month, the Moscow Police Department on Thursday night doubled down on claims the attack was targeted, though they acknowledged the house itself and not its occupants may have been chosen by the still-unidentified killer.The police department restated its belief that the Nov. 13 attack was targeted after investigators on Wednesday said they “do not currently know if the residence or any occupants were specifically targeted.”“We remain consistent in our belief that this was a targeted attack, but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or if it was the occupants,” the department said in a statement.“We continue receiving inquiries about comments made by Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson, who said the suspect(s) specifically looked at the victim’s residence and that one or more of the occupants were undoubtedly targeted. The Moscow Police Department is the only provider of official information regarding this case.”Moscow Police Chief Jim Fry on Thursday explained why police have held back information from the public regarding the investigation into the Nov. 13 murders of four University of Idaho students.Fry also expressed confidence that the team of investigators will solve the case, even though no suspect has been identified yet.Nearly three weeks after Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle were killed in their off-campus residence, little information has been shared to answer questions like how the suspect got into the residence, who specifically was targeted and why other roommates were spared.Fry said when that information is made public, the killer may learn that information, too, which could jeopardize the case. It also might jeopardize the integrity of a trial if an arrest is made.“We’re always going to hold stuff back as much as we possibly can because when you’re talking about the integrity of the case, you’re talking about when this goes to trial, have you tainted jurors?” he said during an interview with the Moscow-Pullman Daily News. “There’s a way bigger picture here than just people knowing. Because for it to be a fair trial, you have to have people who don’t know facts and have already made up their own opinions on them.”Fry confirmed to the Daily News on Thursday that his department still stands by its earlier statements that this was a targeted attack. In an interview with CNN, Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell clarified the recent news release by saying investigators “have not concluded if the target was the residence or its occupants.”As of Wednesday night, 113 pieces of physical evidence have been collected and taken to the Idaho State Police crime lab. More than 260 tips have been submitted to the FBI.That evidence includes DNA from the crime scene, but Fry said he does not yet know when the lab will release the results of that testing. Fry said the police have done “many, many” interviews with people and will continue to follow every lead.Dealing with this evidence, he said, is a time-consuming task that has contributed to the length of this investigation.“I think people need to realize that these things take time in order to get the evidence processed and processed properly without destroying it or contaminating it,” he said. “It takes time to do that.”Fry said he knows the community has become impatient with the pace of the investigation, but he said the collection and processing of the evidence is being done correctly.“I understand people are frustrated with that, but in the end, when you have a rock-solid case, that’s what matters,” he said.He said the hours that passed between when the murders likely happened and the 911 call that was placed just before noon Nov. 13 has not hindered the investigation. Police learn how to adapt to circumstances they cannot change when working a case.“We get dealt the hand we’re dealt, and then we move forward from that point on,” he said.When asked when this case, if it continues to go unsolved, becomes a cold case, Fry expressed confidence it won’t come to that.“I’m not even going to speculate on that, No. 1, because that’s not even in my mind,” he said. “We’re going to solve this. We’re going to continue to work until we solve it.”He called the investigative team made up of Moscow police, FBI and Idaho State Police an “incredible working group.”“There’s no ego,” he said. “We have a focus, we have a job to do and we’re going after the answers to this.”Fry said any tips from the public get sent to the tip line, where staff review them. He said there has been discussion about offering a reward for information leading to an arrest. Fry said while that may happen in the future, police are not ready to do that yet.The Moscow police issued a news release Thursday evening that said they are aware of a sixth person listed on the lease of the King Road residence, but they don’t believe that person was present during the murders.--The Spokesman Review in Spokane and the Moscow-Pullman Daily News contributed.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
‘Mixed emotions’: Portland preschool faces closure as church repurposes land to house Indigenous families,|By Rose Wong || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Education,|Updated: Dec. 02, 2022, 5:42 p.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,252,|Teacher Annette said a large space allows children to explore and become independent learners. "We've grown to realize having a large outdoor space is pretty magical for kids," she said.NEW!252sharesBy Rose Wong || The Oregonian/OregonLiveAfter 25 years of operating in the Presbyterian Church of Laurelhurst, Portland Tillamook Preschool must find a new location by next summer or face closure.Presbytery of the Cascades, a governing body of more than 90 congregations including the Laurelhurst one, informed the preschool in October that it will terminate its lease a year earlier than scheduled. The school will need to vacate the Northeast Portland church building on Northeast 33rd Avenue south of Sandy Boulevard by the end of June.“We regret that we could not continue to maintain the lease for the full five years … but we are now making new commitments to the site and needed to make use of our ‘termination at will’ option in the lease agreement,” said Brian Heron, executive presbyter of the Presbytery of the Cascades.The Presbytery intends to repurpose the land where the church stands into a tiny home village for Indigenous single parents and children. The collaboration with three other entities — Indigenous organization Future Generations Collaborative, affordable housing group Leaven Community Land and Housing Coalition and Westminster Presbytery Church. That may eventually result in the local Indigenous community assuming ownership of the land, as part of the national Land Back movement that advocates for returning land to Indigenous people, Heron said.The Presbytery is also looking for new uses for three of its other properties where congregations have closed, including nine acres in Beaverton that will become affordable housing.“I have such mixed emotions,” said Anna Lagasse, board president of Tillamook Preschool. “I’m feeling responsible for finding this school a new location, but also I think what the church is doing is wonderful.”Lagasse’s 5-year-old son, Grayson, attends the cooperative preschool, a not-for-profit organization run by parents who sign up for responsibilities at the start of the academic year. Parents may be in charge of building maintenance, laundry or administrative work. The school has 38 children split between two classes that meet on alternate days of the week. Classes are run by a teacher, the school’s only paid employee, with the help of at least three parents.While the lease ends in June, registration for the next school year begins in January. The school typically hosts an open house for prospective students and families after the New Year.“It’s hard to draw new families in without a location,” Lagasse said.Preschool allows children to develop social-emotional skills and adjust to environments outside of the home when their brains are most elastic, ensuring that they arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. Extensive research has shown children who attend high-quality preschools experience better social, health and economic outcomes later in life.Working families also rely on preschools for childcare. A 2021 Oregon State University study showed that more than half of Multnomah County’s preschool-aged children did not have access to childcare slots before the pandemic. Every county in the state was designated as a childcare desert for children between ages 0 and 2, meaning 70% of children did not have access to childcare slots, the report found.During the pandemic, Multnomah County lost 300, or a fifth, of its childcare providers, according to the county, putting added strain on families looking for quality childcare options.In its current location, Tillamook Preschool has access to a building with ample natural light, an indoor gym and a large outdoor space with a playground — ideal for a play-based school that encourages creativity and independence through the use of open space, Lagasse said.The church has also offered affordable rent that’s inaccessible in most of Portland, she added. Finding a new, affordable home will be a challenge. Lagasse said they need a minimum of 1,300 square feet of ground-floor classroom space with adequate windows and direct access to an outdoor playground. She said they are asking members of the community to reach out with any leads.Annette Horten has worked for Tillamook Preschool and been known by children and parents as Teacher Annette for 20 years. She said parents whose children have finished preschool years ago still keep in touch.Whatever happens to Tillamook, Horten said she will remain an educator. But she said she’s not thinking about her Plan B right now. She is more concerned about what it would mean for the curious, free-roaming preschoolers that rely on the school if it isn’t able to find a new space that fits their needs.“I’ve always considered this space like a second teacher,” she said.-- Rose Wong covers early childhood education for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Reed College professor to resign eight months after video of racist rant,|By Sami Edge || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Education,|Updated: Dec. 02, 2022, 10:45 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 01, 2022, 4:10 p.m.|,None,|A sign on the Reed College campus advertises a sit-in at the administration building to support immigrant students and decry the college's response to tenured professor Paul Currie's rant about "illegal immigrants."NEW!By Sami Edge || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThis story was updated on Dec. 2 to include comment from Reed College professor Paul Currie.Paul Currie, a tenured psychology professor at Reed College, will resign from his post eight months after a video captured him going on a racist rant against local restaurant employees.Currie, who has apologized for what he called “reprehensible” behavior, said this week that he doesn’t remember the incident and was under the influence of insomnia medication.Currie was on sabbatical in March when a video of him interacting with workers at what looks like a fast food drive-through window prompted campus protests. In the video, Currie says something about “hiring illegal immigrants” and questioning whether an unidentified employee was born in the United States.Currie issued a written apology to the Reed community afterward. Students, frustrated with what they considered a lackluster response from Reed’s administration, staged campus protests demanding the college take steps to address bias and discrimination. Some called for Currie to be fired. In a letter to campus on Wednesday, Reed president Audrey Bilger said a faculty committee investigated the incident and “found no violation of college policy.” However, Bilger said after reviewing the report she spoke with legal experts and Currie, who subsequently resigned from his position, effective January 6.“Since coming to Reed, my priority has been and remains to support students in their educational pursuits, efforts that rely on an inclusive and welcoming campus environment,” Bilger wrote in her letter.Currie penned his own letter to campus, which he shared with The Oregonian/OregonLive on Friday.“I’ve been living with intense shame and regret from an event I - still to this day - do not remember,” Currie wrote. “There is no excuse to ever engage in offensive or discriminatory behavior and I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Currie wrote that the video “depicts complex sleep behavior caused by a medication prescribed by my physician.” Currie told the faculty investigative committee about his history with acute insomnia, and he wrote he believes that’s why the committee found that Reed had no cause to fire him or impose any penalties.Currie defended what he called his decades-long “commitment to students’ diversity and inclusivity,” in the classroom and research laboratory.Referring to diversity, equity and inclusion, he wrote, “My final hope is that we appreciate how DEI contributes to the overall character and openness of the Reed College community.” Paul Currie Statement[49] by sami edge on ScribdThis story was brought to you through a partnership between The Oregonian/OregonLive and Report for America. Learn how to support this crucial work.Sami Edge covers higher education for The Oregonian.

Idaho students largely abandon campus after 4 slain; security drives some to class,By The Associated Press,Public Safety,None,|Published: Nov. 30, 2022, 4:51 p.m.|,None,|Flowers, a stuffed animal, and a framed image featuring the photos of the four people found dead at a house on Nov. 13, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho, rest in the snow in front of the house on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022. The university will be holding a system-wide vigil, Wednesday evening, Nov. 30, 2022 in memory of the students, as investigators continue to look for a suspect and motive in the killings. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)APNEW!By The Associated PressIn a normal year, University of Idaho students would be bustling between classes and the library, readying for the pre-finals cramming period known as “dead week.”On Wednesday, however, a little under half the students appeared to be gone, choosing to stay home and take classes online rather than return to the town where the killings of four classmates remain unsolved, said Blaine Eckles, the university’s dean of students. Some students who were in attendance were relying on university-hired security staffers to drive them to class because they didn’t want to walk across campus alone.The Moscow Police Department has yet to name a person of interest in the stabbing deaths of Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls, Idaho; Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington. The three women lived together in a rental home across the street from campus, and Chapin was there staying that night.A county coroner said they were likely asleep when they were attacked. Two weeks later investigators have yet to find a weapon used in the killings — believed to be a military-style knife — or elaborate on why they think the killings were “targeted.”The killings have left the university and the small farming community that contains it shell-shocked.“When we lose any students, especially under these circumstances, my heart is absolutely broken,” Eckles said. “It shakes you to your core a little bit, knowing that in this community, which is incredibly safe in general, can have something this horrific happen.”Now, as students and faculty members try to navigate a quagmire of grief and fear, government agencies and community members are searching for answers and trying to help lessen the damage.Gov. Brad Little announced last week that he was directing up to $1 million in state emergency funds for the investigation. The FBI has assigned 44 people to the case — half of them stationed in Moscow — and the Idaho State Police has 15 troopers helping with community patrols and another 20 investigators working the case.Some community members started online fundraising campaigns to support family members and friends of the slain students. A university alum began raising money to equip women on campus with handheld personal safety alarms. By last week, Kerry Uhlorn had brought in more than $18,000, ordered more than 700 of the alarms and had plans to buy 900 more, Boise television station KTVB reported.Thousands of people were expected to join the university community in mourning Wednesday evening, with several simultaneous candlelight vigils scheduled across the state. The school districts in Boise and Meridian announced plans to light up their athletic fields at the same time in solidarity.Still, the question for faculty members and students remains: How do they focus on learning with four friends gone and a killer on the loose? Staffers are talking directly to students about how to handle the challenge, Eckles said.“It’s the elephant in the room, right? It’s hard to do that,” Eckles said. “Our faculty are also really understanding that it’s going to be a hard time for students to kind of focus and concentrate at this time. So they’re being very patient and leading with a lot of grace. And quite frankly, I think our students are doing that with our employees as well.”Local law enforcement agencies have seen an uptick in calls reporting suspicious behavior.“We understand there is a sense of fear in our community,” the Moscow Police Department wrote on Nov. 27. Since the killings, the number of people requesting welfare checks, in which an officer is sent to check on a person’s wellbeing, has doubled.The university has also seen an increase in people calling its “Vandal Care” phone line to report that they were struggling or worried someone else was struggling with an issue, Eckles said.“While I personally am very confident that the police will resolve (the deaths), until that happens, no one is resting easy,” he said. “There’s someone out there that took the lives of four of our Vandals, and we don’t know who they are. We don’t know where they are.”Eckes added he hopes the vigils will offer some temporary comfort, but the community will not “ultimately be able to heal until someone is brought to justice for this crime.”Some of the victims’ family members were expected to attend the vigils.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Woodburn School District faces $3M suit after football coach convicted of sexually abusing teen,|By Zane Sparling || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Public Safety,None,|Published: Nov. 30, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,None,|FILEFile artNEW!By Zane Sparling || The Oregonian/OregonLiveA former student at Woodburn High School sued the district Monday after its former head football coach was convicted of sexually abusing her when she was 17.Nicholas Federico, now 41, was sentenced Nov. 15 to 2½ years in state prison and must register as a sex offender after a jury convicted him of second-degree sexual abuse and luring a minor during the 2017-2018 school year.The suit filed in Marion County Circuit Court seeks $3 million in damages for the student’s pain and suffering, alleging that the district failed to prevent the sexual abuse, some of which occurred in Federico’s office and in his truck while it was parked at a middle school campus.“She’s held Mr. Frederico accountable,” said Barbara Long, the student’s attorney. “And now she wants to hold the school district accountable.”Woodburn School District spokesperson Rachel Danskey declined to comment on the pending litigation.Federico taught the student’s freshman and sophomore weightlifting classes, then posed as a “confidant and teacher she could trust” after the student became pregnant and asked if she could volunteer with the coach to raise her grades before graduation, according to the lawsuit.He provided the student with his personal cell number and began sending explicit messages, according to the lawsuit and records in the criminal case. The sexual abuse began at Federico’s home on prom night when his wife was out of town, the student testified during the jury trial.They continued to meet after the student turned 18, but contact ceased in July 2019, Federico’s defense attorney, Zachary Stern, wrote in court filings in the criminal case.The coach eventually paid the student $20,000, but balked after the victim demanded an additional $10,000, the defense attorney argued. The student then sent intimate images of Federico to his family members, according to Stern, who didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Authorities later recovered “love letters” from other students in Federico’s desk during an investigation, according to court records. Federico’s mother was one of the top administrators at the high school.The criminal case turned political last month after a prosecutor pushed Marion County Circuit Judge Erious Johnson, who was up for election Nov. 8, to determine Federico’s punishment before voters marked their ballots. Johnson ultimately sentenced Federico after losing the election.Court records say Federico had been provisionally licensed as a physical education teacher in Oregon since 2010, though a copy of his certification was not available in a state database. Court records indicate the licensure was set to expire in 2022.Long said the former student is now focused on parenting and taking college classes.“When Mr. Federico targeted and groomed her, she was at a very vulnerable point in her life. She was isolated,” Long said. “But she truly has taken steps to improve life for herself and for her daughter.”— Zane Sparling; zsparling@oregonian.com; 503-319-7083; @pdxzaneOur journalism needs your support.

Tempelis said she frequently ate at Mad Greek in downtown where victims Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen worked for several years.Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News via APNEW!By Tribune News ServiceSally Krutzig and Shaun Goodwin || The Idaho StatesmanIt’s been more than two weeks since four University of Idaho students were found dead in a house near campus, and as some students return to Moscow following Thanksgiving break and others opt to finish the semester remotely, police still have not identified a suspect in the homicides.The Moscow Police Department, Idaho State Police and FBI are all involved in the investigation, but have said repeatedly that they are keeping many details confidential to maintain the integrity of the investigation.It’s been almost a week since the most recent news conference was held. Here’s what we know about the investigation and what happened that weekend.What happened on that weekend?Shortly before noon Pacific time on Sunday, Nov. 13, Moscow police officers responded to a 911 call about an unconscious person in a house near the U of I campus. They walked in to find four dead bodies. Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt reported that they had been stabbed to death with a large, fixed-blade knife in the early morning hours.The coroner’s report did not include times of death, but Moscow Mayor Art Bettge previously told the Idaho Statesman that the students were killed between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. that Sunday.Autopsies confirmed that all four died from multiple stab wounds and that all were likely asleep when the attacks started. Some victims showed defensive wounds. None of the victims showed signs of sexual assault, the coroner said.Who were the victims?The four were University of Idaho seniors Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum; junior Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls; and freshman Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington.The three women — Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves — lived at the King Road home with at least two other roommates, both of whom survived.Chapin was staying the night with Kernodle, whom he was dating.This is the off-campus residence where four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in their beds.TNSWhere did the 911 call come from?The two surviving roommates had been out that night but were not together. Police have said both were home by about 1 a.m. on Sunday and would have been in the house at the time of the attack.They were unharmed and did not wake up until late Sunday morning, according to police. Both had bedrooms on the first floor. The victims were found on the second and third floors — two on each floor. Police would not specify which victims were where.Police revealed that the 911 call was made from inside the house on one of the surviving roommates’ cellphones. The surviving roommates summoned friends to the house because they believed one of the victims on the second floor had passed out and was not waking up. Multiple people there talked with the 911 dispatcher before officers arrived, the Moscow Police Department said.Where did it happen?The homicides happened in Moscow, situated along the Idaho-Washington state line, about 30 miles north of Lewiston and 85 miles south of Coeur d’Alene. It’s home to the University of Idaho.Moscow has a population of about 25,850, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and U of I reports an enrollment of 11,507 students. The city is just a 9-mile drive from Pullman, Washington, which is home to the larger Washington State University.The six-bedroom house where the students were living was just off campus in the 1100 block of King Road.What do we know about the shelter-in-place order the day of the killings?U of I told people to “stay away from the area and shelter in place” at 2:07 p.m. Pacific time on Nov. 13 as the police department investigated a homicide. Nearly 90 minutes later, the university tweeted that the shelter in place order was lifted, but called for Moscow residents to “remain vigilant.”According to the U of I website, a shelter-in-place order can be issued by the University Office of Public Safety and Security in response to a hazardous spill, hostile intruder or weather emergency. An order is sent out using the Vandal Alert system. It requires students, faculty and visitors to take refuge in an interior room with no or few windows.Boise State University students and others pay their respects at a vigil for the University of Idaho students who were killed.TNSDo we know why this happened?Police have given little information about a possible motive for the killings, but law enforcement have repeatedly said they believe it to be a “targeted attack.” They have declined to give further information about what led to that belief.“To be honest, you’re going to have to trust us on that at this point because we’re not going to release why we think that,” Moscow Police Capt. Roger Lanier said last week.At another news conference, Fry declined to say whether the attack was carried out by a single person or multiple people, and could not say whether one of the roommates was explicitly targeted.What were the victims doing before the attack?Kernodle and Chapin had been at a party at the Sigma Chi fraternity house — less than a mile from the house on King Road — and returned home at about 1:45 a.m. Sunday.Goncalves and Mogen had spent the evening at the Corner Club bar before stopping at a downtown food truck on the way home. They used a “private party” to ride home from the food truck, police said last week. Both girls also arrived home at around 1:45 a.m.Multiple calls were made from Goncalves’ and Mogen’s cellphones between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. to a male who did not answer. A sister of Goncalves, Alivea, said the calls were made to an individual named Jack who is a friend. Alivea said her sister was known for frequently making late-night phone calls.Have police cleared anyone?Detectives have said they do not believe that the two surviving roommates or any individuals summoned to the household on Sunday morning were involved in the crime.The police also cleared a male singled out in surveillance footage of the Grub Truck food truck, the “private party” driver who took Goncalves and Mogen home early that morning, and the individual called by Goncalves and Mogen.The Latah County Sheriff’s Office and Moscow police have addressed numerous rumors and questions surrounding the homicides. This includes a reported incident involving a dog attacked with a knife elsewhere in Moscow that the sheriff’s office said was unrelated.Moscow police also said Saturday that the Moscow stabbings are not tied to a a 1999 double stabbing in Pullman, Washington, as well as a 2021 double stabbing in Salem, Oregon. On Nov. 23, Lainier also acknowledged that police had been unable to validate reports that Goncalves had a stalker — information that came out in interviews — but said the department would continue to seek information regarding it.In an email release Monday, police said a February 2022 death in Moscow is not related to the quadruple homicide investigation. Police said the Latah County Coroner’s Office ruled that death to be from an overdose.Police also said reports that a red Mustang on S. Deakin Street was being processed as part of the murder investigation were not true and that the vehicle “is not connected to this incident.”What is the school doing?U of I President Scott Green told students in a memo ahead of Thanksgiving break that the school would “remain flexible” through the end of the semester. University faculty have been asked to prepare both in-person and remote learning options so students who do not wish to return to Moscow until the spring semester can finish their fall courses online.Drop-in counseling for students through the Counseling and Testing Center will remain throughout the week of Nov. 28. Students can also make an appointment at (208) 885-6716. The phone line provides 24-hour-a-day access to counselors.The university’s Safe Walk program will be available throughout the rest of the semester. The service allows students, faculty and guests to call (208) 885-7233 and have a campus security officer meet them anywhere on campus and walk them to their destination.A candlelight vigil planned for U of I’s campus on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Pacific time has been moved indoors to the Kibbie Dome because of strong wind forecasts, the school said in a release Monday night. The U of I Boise campus, U of I Idaho Falls, Idaho State University and College of Eastern Idaho will all hold simultaneous vigils on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Mountain time.--Sally Krutzig and Shaun Goodwin/The Idaho Statesman/Tribune News ServiceIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Miller/Idaho Statesman via AP)APNEW!By The Associated PressAuthorities investigating the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students in their beds said Tuesday that detectives have looked extensively into information that one of the victims had a stalker and have not been able to verify it.Investigators have pursued hundreds of pieces of information about Kaylee Goncalves having a stalker but haven’t been able to identify one, the Moscow Police Department said in a news release.Authorities have said they have no suspect or weapon more than a week after the Nov. 13 killings shook the Idaho Panhandle town of 25,000 residents.Anyone with information that could help detectives with the stalker tips are asked to contact Moscow police.Police also said Tuesday that there’s been much conversation about how to describe the weapon used and that the type used in the attacks is believed to be a fix-blade knife.Police said Monday they would hold a news conference to update the public on the investigation at 1 p.m. Wednesday.The victims were Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington; Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls, Idaho; and Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho. The women were roommates, and Chapin was dating Kernodle.Authorities have said they were each stabbed multiple times, and that some had defensive wounds.On Sunday, law enforcement officers investigating the deaths asked for patience after a week passed with no arrests.Police have said evidence leads them to believe the students were targeted, but have repeatedly declined to give details.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Regular tutoring can help students catch up post-pandemic, but it’s slow to roll out in Oregon|,|By Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Education,|Updated: Nov. 23, 2022, 12:31 p.m.|||,|Published: Nov. 23, 2022, 8:03 a.m.|,104,|Dominic Villanueva, a second grader at Durham Elementary in Tigard, works one-on-one with his virtual reading tutor.Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLiveNEW!104sharesBy Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLiveIn the furious effort to help students catch up in reading and math after two-plus years of pandemic upheaval, states around the country are zeroing in on a particular strategy: frequent, individualized tutoring.But not Oregon.The state’s 197 school districts have $1.1 billion in federal pandemic aid to spend as they see fit by 2024.So far, only 8% of districts have told the state Department of Education that they are earmarking some of it for so-called “high-dosage” tutoring, despite an emerging consensus among education researchers that it’s one of the most effective ways to help struggling students catch up.Key elements of the high-dose variety are that it takes place one-on-one or in groups of no more than three, during the school day, multiple times per week, with the same adult. If done right, researchers say, it can bring students up an entire grade level within a single school year.High-quality tutoring like this is expensive and potentially difficult to staff and sustain. Teachers and administrators need to monitor student progress, and—ideally—carve out time for tutoring within the school day. Companies offering virtual tutoring services have flooded into the market in the past few years, and districts need to figure out which if any are worth the money.To combat the difficulty of getting tutoring programs up and running, a number of states — including Tennessee, New Jersey, Texas and Illinois — have launched concerted efforts to help districts navigate the tutoring landscape, including creating databases of recommended virtual tutoring providers and connecting districts with a network of in-person tutors from local universities and volunteer programs.Oregon, by contrast, has isolated efforts in the planning stages in a handful of school districts and pilot programs getting off the ground in others.“Districts are best positioned to understand their student and community needs,” said Marc Siegel, spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Education. “[Federal pandemic relief] funds empower districts to tailor their efforts to these local needs.”Maya Erdman and her classmates at Durham Elementary in Tigard participate in a virtual tutoring session focused on reading.Julia Silverman || The Oregonian/OregonLivePATIENT, PHONICS-BASED HELPAt 12:11 pm every weekday, the bright, open atrium at the center of Durham Elementary in Tigard is quiet and empty, with most students off at recess or lunch. Two minutes later, the chattering of 16 second graders bounces off the rafters, as students race in, grab their seats, find an iPad, slip on a giant pair of headphones and greet their reading tutors, who are beaming in from around the country.All 16 read below grade level, but that doesn’t mean they all need the same help. Some are still working on sounding out individual letters (“Zz for zebra”), some are on compound blends (“Ch for chap or chat”), some can “partner read” a simple paragraph, taking turns with their tutor, sentence by sentence.The urgent goal: Get them to grade level by the end of the year. Decades of research shows that if students can’t read independently by third grade, they’re at much greater risk of falling behind, and ultimately, dropping out.Durham serves a greater concentration of students navigating poverty than most of Tigard-Tualatin’s nine other elementaries, which is part of why district officials chose it to pilot the high-dose help. All children taking part are in special education, eligible for free school meals or learning English as a second language.The chosen 16 see their tutors every school day for 15-minute sessions. The same grown-up, day in and day out, offers patient, phonics-based instruction. Though the program has only been in place since early October, Durham principal Cleann Brewer says most of the children have already shown measurable improvement.Sixty-three percent of them are reading six to 10 more grade-level words per minute than when tutoring started seven weeks ago, which Brewer says is “huge.”“Some of these kids didn’t do well online, so I was skeptical at first,” she says. “But they show up on time every day. They’re really disappointed if there is some kind of tutor issue. And they are engaged 100% of those minutes.”It doesn’t, however, come cheap. Tigard-Tualatin is spending $40,000 to pilot this program at Durham this year. If any of the initial participants improve enough to hit grade level, another child can have their seat.Across Oregon, just 15 districts have informed the state that they plan to spend a portion of their federal relief funds on high-dosage tutoring, Siegel says. That includes four of the state’s largest districts — Portland, Salem, Eugene and Medford — and some of its smallest, including the Annex School District in Malheur County, with just 61 students. (The rest are Culver, Dallas, Douglas County, Lincoln County, Malheur County, Mollala River, South Umpqua, Sutherlin and Three Rivers/Josephine County.)An additional 17 districts have told the state they are setting aside at least some of their federal money for tutoring but have yet to specify how many times a week it will be offered to students and for how long. Some districts could be offering high-dose tutoring using other funding sources that don’t require them to tell the state what they’re spending it on.BEYOND K-5In an ideal world, individualized instruction would be much more broadly available, even for students who are at grade level but could have been much further along if not for pandemic-related disruptions, says Andrew McEachin, a program director at Portland-based testing and research outfit NWEA.Still, the Durham program is well-designed, he says, starting with the fact that the tutoring is built into the school day. Brewer says she pushed for that, so she and others on her staff could pop in regularly to make sure everything was running smoothly and consistently. The second graders miss 15 minutes of math instruction, but their teachers go over what they’ve missed when they return, while their classmates are doing independent work.Holding tutoring before school ran the risk of kids oversleeping or busy caregivers not getting there in time, she says; after school, many kids peel off for other activities or are simply spent after the school day.Virtual tutoring programs like the Ignite! Reading one in use at Durham are gaining in popularity, particularly given a tight job market in the Portland area as well as in the more rural corners of the state, which have long struggled to hire and keep educators. A virtual program should include a live, trained tutor on the other side of the camera, McEachin says. Chat-based, self-paced-and-monitored programs can leave students disengaged and frustrated, he says.And while many districts are gearing their tutoring programs to younger students, McEachin points out that they have more years of schooling to get caught up, while middle and high schoolers’ window is closing more rapidly.Portland Public Schools has nearly $1.1 million in federal pandemic relief funds set aside for a high-dosage tutoring program. District officials say tutoring will begin to roll out in January at elementary and K-8 schools with the highest need for reading support. Tutoring for middle schoolers and high schoolers will follow later, they say.Portland’s programs will operate three days a week after school, with 30- to 45-minute in-person sessions led by district employees. Each tutor will be paired with no more than three students. Participation will be voluntary but highly encouraged, with outreach to families from teachers and administrators.Few other metro-area districts have told the state that they plan to spend federal pandemic relief funds on tutoring. The Reynolds School District, where test scores suggest that most children are below grade level, makes no mention of it in the budget document that they were required to file with the state. The Beaverton School District says it is spending federal relief dollars on half-time “academic coaches” at all of its elementary schools and full-time ones at its middle schools, at a cost of about $4.5 million a year. Their duties are split between professional development for teachers and individual help for students.Corbett, on the outskirts of Multnomah County, spent $30,000 to hire a math paraeducator who leads one-on-one math tutoring on Fridays, and $37,000 for a part-time language arts teacher who also tutors on Fridays.NO EASY SOLUTIONSSome parents are taking matters into their own hands. In Beaverton, Amanda Coen, whose children attend Raleigh Hills K-8, raised money for an after-school tutoring program there that is just getting up and running. It’s for 10 second and third graders who are struggling with reading and gives them an hour a week with an online one-on-one tutor. It also provides 15 minutes a day of reading games to do on a computer at home, with devices given to families in need.Her goal and hope, Coen says, is to expand the pilot into all of the district’s 32 elementary schools, but the price tag is substantial. It cost $35,000 just to get her phonics-based pilot into Raleigh Hills for this school year. But having seen her own daughter, now a middle schooler, struggle with literacy, she knew firsthand the desperation kids might be feeling.“My turning point was laying in bed with my daughter, and she was crying,” Coen recalled of a conversation a few years ago. “And she said, ‘I feel really dumb, because I don’t know when to turn the page. [So] I just wait until the person next to me turns the page, so I don’t look like I am falling behind, or reading slow.’ She wasn’t reading. She didn’t know how to read.”Tutoring is not a silver bullet, more like one arrow in a quiver. Schools nationwide are experimenting with multiple strategies to help with academic recovery. Doubling up on math instruction during the school day is one possibility. Extending the school day or school year is another, but requires reopening contract negotiations with teacher unions, which could prove contentious, particularly for a workforce that already feels both burnt out and under the gun. Summer school holds promise but needs family buy-in and careful design.The Biden administration, meanwhile, is placing a high-stakes bet on the power of tutoring, underwriting an ambitious plan to send 250,000 tutors into American schools over the next three years.Some education researchers say the effort should go even further. They’ve called for an all-hands-on-deck approach to tutoring. Send high-achieving high schoolers and community college students into the elementary schools to earn credits, they say, and college students into middle and high schools. Mobilize parent volunteers and retired teachers and call in Americorps, they say, given the dire results on national and state test scores.Such efforts sound wonderful in theory but would be logistically challenging, said Brewer, the principal in Tigard, given the effort of finding and training qualified tutors, and then making sure that they stick with the job.Virtual programs outsource that work, but districts need to make sure they are aligned with their core curriculum standards and capable of tracking and reporting student progress, McEachin said.Christine Pitts, the director of impact at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at Arizona State University and a former research and evaluation lead at Portland Public Schools, said the complex logistics of launching a successful tutoring program at the needed scale is precisely why districts need more specific direction from the state.“Teachers do tutoring. And there is small group instruction to address student learning needs. That’s happening. But in typical Oregon fashion, it’s patchwork,” Pitts said. “From one part of the state to another, you have people developing different initiatives here and there. It’s important for us to have local adaptations based on different challenges and communities. But when you have [all the] districts in the state doing all different things, it’s really hard for state leaders to point to successes across the state to say that we had big wins.”— Julia Silverman, jsilverman@oregonian.com, @jrlsilvermanOur journalism needs your support.

|Dear Doctor: What is follicular lymphoma, and do I need to treat it immediately?|,By Dr. Keith Roach,Health,None,|Published: Dec. 05, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: I am an 86-year-old woman who was recently diagnosed with follicular lymphoma, stage 3A. It was discovered on a CAT scan when I went to the ER for diverticulitis. I have no symptoms. The doctor did a biopsy to confirm, and I had a PET scan as well. I feel good otherwise. I am only on blood pressure and cholesterol medications.My oncologist is recommending low-dose chemotherapy. I am conflicted. At my age, what should I do? -- L.H.ANSWER: There are many types of lymphomas, which are a type of cancer of blood cells, but unlike leukemias, lymphomas are predominantly in the lymph nodes. Follicular lymphoma is an “indolent” type of lymphoma, meaning it is very slow-growing, but unfortunately often uncurable. People with no symptoms from follicular lymphoma and who are stage 1, 2 or 3A tend to have a long time before they have progression of the disease to the point of having symptoms. Depending on other characteristics, that time ranges from an average of three years to an average of seven years. Choosing to hold off on treatment is definitely a reasonable option for a person in your situation.However, your oncologist knows much more about your disease than I do, such as the extent of tumor in the abdomen, the molecular markers of the tumor and additional blood results. When an oncologist suggests treatment, I would listen carefully. One treatment that your oncologist might be considering is immunological therapy, such as rituximab. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, rituximab alone is pretty nontoxic and can delay the progression of the disease. A large study suggested improvement in the quality of life with the rituximab. Usually, rituximab is given once a week for four doses, but some oncologists repeat the four doses every two months.If I had a patient in your situation, I would say holding off on treatment would be reasonable, given your age and lack of symptoms, but a trial of the rituximab (if that is what the oncologist is contemplating) would also be a reasonable choice. If you had serious side effects to the treatment, I would recommend against further doses.DEAR DR. ROACH: I recently read your column on astaxanthin. The article contained a statement that flabbergasted me. Can you explain the details behind it? You state: “Most astaxanthin sold commercially is synthesized from petroleum products.” What gives? -- K.O.K.ANSWER: Any drug, supplement or chemical you buy is either extracted and purified from a natural source or is synthesized in chemical reactions (or some combination of the two). For example, if you buy curcumin from the health food store, the supplement might start off as the roots of the shrub Curcuma longa in the ginger family. Then, these are boiled in water and baking soda and also powdered, making turmeric. Curcumin is purified from turmeric through the use of a solvent like acetone and crystalized to make pure curcumin.However, curcumin from the health food store might also be synthesized directly from vanillin, which, in turn, is derived from wood pulp or from crude oil. No matter whether the curcumin starts -- as turmeric roots from India, as wood pulp or as oil -- the chemical you take is exactly the same, and your body doesn’t know where it comes from.Keep in mind that the manufacturer chooses the least expensive way of getting you what you want.* * *Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

That’s an attention-grabbing first sentence. So is “your gas stove can make you and your children sick,” the first sentence in a recent news article on OregonLive (“Gas stoves are hazardous to your health, Multnomah County report says,” Nov. 10).Of those two sentences, only one is supported by conclusive data - the first one.The Multnomah County report should be subject to scrutiny and its findings challenged. Instead, its conclusions become headlines and soundbites; part of a public relations campaign aimed at persuading the public to accept bans on gas hookups and appliances.In another recent study, GTI Energy concludes that cooking on an electric range may have a greater adverse impact on indoor air quality than cooking on a gas one. As with the Multnomah study, further research is needed.That eye-opening stat about fire deaths comes from an objective study of fire data by the National Fire Protection Agency. Missing from that report is any suggestion that electric stoves be banned, and rightly so.Low-carbon fuels like natural gas and propane and an increasing array of ultra-low carbon renewable fuels such as renewable propane can help decarbonize communities while alleviating strain on an overburdened electric grid.We should focus more on that story and take each story about an agenda-driven study with a grain of salt.Tucker Perkins and Matt SolakPerkins is president and chief executive of Propane Education & Research Council.

The federation’s lawyer writes that Measure 114′s “draconian terms turn the Second Amendment on its head…”The definition of a draconian law is one that is excessively harsh. Measure 114 is not draconian by any reasonable measure. It requires a permit to purchase a gun. It bans the sale, transfer or purchase of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. Every other western democracy has gun regulations far more stringent than these. In fact, their governments reacted quickly when they experienced their first mass shootings.

Oregon flu reports spike; influenza spread ‘very high’ in state,By The Associated Press,Health,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 9:30 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 11:09 a.m.|,220,|This map from the Centers for Disease Control shows Oregon in the very high category for flu-like illness for the week ending Nov. 26, 2022.NEW!220sharesBy The Associated PressThe U.S. flu season keeps getting worse, and Oregon’s along with it.Health officials said Friday that 7.5% of outpatient medical visits last week were due to flu-like illnesses. That’s as high as the peak of the 2017-18 flu season and higher than any season since.The annual winter flu season usually doesn’t get going until December or January, but this one began early and has been complicated by the simultaneous spread of other viruses.The measure of traffic in doctor’s offices is based on reports of symptoms like coughs and sore throats, not on lab-confirmed diagnoses. So it may include other respiratory illnesses.That makes it hard to compare to flu seasons from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Other years also didn’t have this year’s unusually strong wave of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be serious for infants and the elderly.Meanwhile, 44 states reported high or very high flu activity last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Oregon and Washington are both in the very high category.This graphic shows the percent of positive flu tests in Oregon since 2017.That may not bode well for the near future. It’s likely there was more spread of respiratory viruses during Thanksgiving gatherings and at crowded airports, experts say.The dominant flu strain so far is the kind typically associated with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in people 65 and older.The CDC estimates there have been at least 78,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths from flu so far this season. The deaths include at least 14 children.In the tri-county Portland area, 7,583 people tested positive for the flu and 78 people were hospitalized in the week ending Nov. 26th, the most recent data released by the Oregon Health Authority. That is a 56% increase in hospitalizations from the previous week.Flu shots are recommended for nearly all Americans who are at least 6 months old or older.-- The Associated Press and The Oregonian/OregonLive contributedOur journalism needs your support.

Why ‘mpox’? What happened to name ‘monkeypox’?,By wire reports,Nation/World,None,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 9:35 a.m.|,None,|FILE - This image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) shows a colorized transmission electron micrograph of monkeypox particles (red) found within an infected cell (blue), cultured in the laboratory that was captured and color-enhanced at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Md. The World Health Organization has renamed monkeypox as mpox, citing concerns the original name of the decades-old animal disease could be construed as discriminatory and racist. (NIAID via AP, File)NEW!By wire reportsMpox is the new name public health officials are using for monkeypox.The World Health Organization announced last week it would begin using “mpox” as the preferred term for monkeypox because of “racist and stigmatizing language online, in other settings and in some communities.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly followed suit.“We welcome the change by the World Health Organization. We must do all we can to break down barriers to public health, and reducing stigma associated with disease is one critical step in our work to end mpox,” said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.Mpox cases in OregonUntil May, monkeypox, a disease that is thought to originate in animals, was not known to trigger large outbreaks beyond central and west Africa.Outside of Africa, nearly all cases have been in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. Scientists believe monkeypox triggered outbreaks in Western countries after spreading via sex at two raves in Belgium and Spain. Vaccination efforts in rich countries, along with targeted control interventions, have mostly brought the disease under control after it peaked in the summer.In Africa, the disease mainly affects people in contact with infected animals such as rodents and squirrels. The majority of monkeypox-related deaths have been in Africa, where there have been almost no vaccines available.WHO said it was concerned by the “racist and stigmatizing language” that arose after monkeypox spread to more than 100 countries.The decision by WHO, the international body responsible for naming diseases, was made after meetings with world leaders who expressed concern for this language and requested a name change. WHO consulted with experts, countries and the public before making its decision, citing concerns the original name of the decades-old animal disease could be construed as discriminatory and racist.Based on those meetings, the organization announced, it now recommends that mpox will become a preferred term, replacing monkeypox, after a transition period of one year. This serves to mitigate the concerns raised by experts about confusion caused by a name change in the midst of a global outbreak. It also gives time to complete the International Health Related Classifications update process and to update WHO publications.Updating a name usually takes years, WHO wrote, but the process was accelerated in this instance.The disease was first called human monkeypox in 1970 after the virus that causes it was found in captive monkeys in 1958. That was nearly 50 years before WHO adopted its best practices in naming diseases.Those practices state “new disease names should be given with the aim to minimize unnecessary negative impact of names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.”Separately, the federal government announced it planned to end in January the public health emergency it declared earlier this year after an outbreak of mpox infected more than 29,000 people across the U.S.Mpox cases have plummeted in recent weeks, with just a handful of new infections being reported every week in the month of November, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the height of the outbreak, over the summer, hundreds of people were being infected weekly.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Readers respond: Congress should restore expanded child tax credit,|By Letters to the editor || The Oregonian|,Opinion,None,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 6:30 a.m.|,None,|NEW!By Letters to the editor || The OregonianThe recent midterm elections saw many voters rejecting extremist candidates and embracing those who really are trying to use government to help their constituents. Although taxes raise money that can be spent on the public good, tax policies always favor some folks more than others.During the height of the pandemic, the expanded Child Tax Credit reduced the child poverty rate by 40%. A simple monthly payment allowed parents to stay home with their kids—or to pay for daycare so that they could go to work. The Niskanen Center supports the child tax credit, and Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimates that its social benefits (lower infant mortality, lower long-term health care costs, more children becoming more productive citizens) outweigh the costs by eight to one. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, has been one of the child tax credit’s strongest supporters. The expanded credit was allowed to lapse, but with the lessons of the midterms in mind the members of Congress now have a chance to restore it.

Dear Doctor: Do AREDS 2 vitamins help moderate the effects of glaucoma?,By Dr. Keith Roach,Health,None,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 6:00 a.m.|,None,|Dr. Keith Roach is a physician at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He writes an educational column on infectious diseases, public health and sports medicine.North America SyndicateNEW!By Dr. Keith RoachDEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 72-year-old male in good health who was told this week that my eyes have shown the beginning of glaucoma. There is no change in my 20/20 vision yet. In 2014, I had cataract surgery in both eyes. Is there any evidence that AREDS 2 vitamins (special eye vitamins) will do anything to moderate the effects of glaucoma? -- R.C.ANSWER: Although there are many eye diseases, three of the most important ones in older adults are glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. There can be some confusion over what these are.Glaucoma is a disease of the retina that is usually (but not always) associated with high pressure in the eye. A person can get glaucoma with normal eye pressures, and some people with high eye pressures never get glaucoma. But, we often treat people with high pressures to prevent glaucoma from developing, and will certainly treat people with glaucoma and normal eye pressures with medication -- almost always eye drops to reduce eye pressure. Some people with glaucoma, or those who are at risk due to eye pressure or anatomy, benefit from laser surgery rather than medication. Eye doctors screen for glaucoma with a comprehensive eye exam, including a careful look at the retina, and by measuring eye pressures. Vision loss in glaucoma is gradual and is often not noticed, since it is in the peripheral vision. Vitamins have no effect on glaucoma.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a very different condition. It’s not clear exactly how the condition starts, but it can be “wet” (with abnormal blood vessels) or “dry” (more common, with atrophy of the macula, the part of the retina in the center where our vision is sharpest). AMD is diagnosed by an eye exam. Wet AMD has treatment options, such as injections into the eye of medications to stop abnormal blood vessels from growing. Dry AMD is treated with the AREDS or AREDS 2 vitamins, which slow progression of the disease.You know all about cataracts, having had surgery. They are opacities in the lens of the eye, causing gradual cloudiness of the vision. If you live long enough, you will develop cataracts. Surgery is the treatment for cataracts.DEAR DR. ROACH: Which type of calcium supplement is best absorbed?  How many milligrams do you suggest for a woman in her 60s? -- D.R.ANSWER: Most calcium supplements sold are either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate, and either one is reasonable in people who need calcium supplementation. I prefer dietary calcium when possible: Calcium supplements increase the risk of kidney stones, while calcium in food (dairy products and fish with tiny bones, such as sardines, are excellent sources) decreases kidney stone risk. Further, there is some suggestion that calcium supplementation may increase heart disease risk, and while the evidence is conflicting, calcium from food seems safer than calcium supplements to me.The standard recommendation is 1,200 mg of elemental calcium a day from a combination of food and supplements for a woman over 50 or a man over 70. (Read labels carefully: A 1,250 mg serving, which may be one or more tablets of calcium carbonate, contains 500 mg of elemental calcium.) Calcium carbonate is best absorbed with food, while calcium citrate is well absorbed with or without food. Calcium carbonate is not well-absorbed by people taking proton pump inhibitor medicines like omeprazole (Prilosec).Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

|Multnomah County officials want you to wear a face mask to slow spread of respiratory viruses, relieve hospital crowding|,|By Fedor Zarkhin || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Coronavirus,|Updated: Dec. 03, 2022, 9:00 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 01, 2022, 5:08 p.m.|,832,|Randall Children's Hospital in North Portland.NEW!832sharesBy Fedor Zarkhin || The Oregonian/OregonLiveMultnomah County and hospital officials are urging people to immediately take steps to stem the tide of respiratory virus infections that are causing “historical” levels of pressure on the local health care system, including by voluntarily wearing facial coverings through year’s end.At issue is a confluence of factors several years in the making, including a general shortage of hospital staff and Oregonians’ weakened protections from influenza and RSV due to two years of isolation because of COVID-19. As a result, the tri-county area has seen the highest pediatric hospitalization numbers for RSV during the five years the state has tracked those numbers, even as the flu season is ratcheting up fast. On top of that, COVID-19 hospitalizations have climbed far more than was previously expected, further straining the health care system.“We’ve used the word ‘unprecedented’ a lot in the last three years,” Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Vines said at a press briefing Thursday. “So it’s hard to know how to ratchet that up. We are at what our people are calling a historical moment.”The strain has hit children’s hospitals especially hard, in large part because of cases of RSV, a common virus that can be particularly dangerous to kids under five. All three of Oregon’s hospitals with pediatric intensive care beds recently switched to “crisis standards of care,” which allows them to assign more patients per staff member.The crisis standards also would allow the hospitals to ration care, though hospital representatives who joined Vines on the call said they are not doing so and hope they won’t have to.“We are going to continue to stretch and continue to stretch to do everything we can to meet the needs of the kids who really need our care,” said Dr. Carl Eriksson, a Doernbecher pediatric specialist. “We’re working very hard, but we’re not there yet.”RSV hospitalizations have either peaked or will peak soon, according to an Oregon Health & Science University forecast.Asked to elaborate whether the county and its hospitals expect to reach a point when they do have to ration care, Vines said this risk is “not our message today” and that the steps people can take to prevent that outcome is.To stem the tide of respiratory virus infections and hospitalizations, Vines asked for a “personal, voluntary action” for everyone to wear a mask while indoors at least until Jan. 1, urged people to get vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19, wash their hands and stay home if they are sick.— Fedor ZarkhinIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Burnside St., is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”NEW!579sharesBy Savannah Eadens || The Oregonian/OregonLiveCautious but eager customers crowded a bright commercial storefront on West Burnside Street on Thursday.On display were typical items. Supplements. Teas. Chocolates. Even jerky.Plus a not-at-all discreet menu of prices for what the store identifies as different strains of dried psilocybin fungus, including 3.5 grams of “Knobby Tops” for $50 and 7 grams of “Albino Penis Envy” for $95.“Are you looking for a functional micro-dose? Or do you want to go on a hike with some color enhancement and sparkles?” an unidentified employee asked a customer.“I just want to have a normal day, but like with a smile,” a man in line replied.Shroom House, at 1541 W. Burnside St., is branding itself as a wellness shop but is very much selling psilocybin in a dispensary-like setting – a retail format that is not legal in Oregon.Oregon’s legal psilocybin program was created under Measure 109 and passed by voters in 2020. That program will allow people 21 and older to take the substance in a controlled, therapeutic environment under the supervision of trained facilitators when psychedelic mushrooms become legal in January 2023, according to the text of the measure. Measure 109 did not allow for the retail sale of psilocybin.Under Measure 110, effective since early 2021, misdemeanor drug possession including psilocybin can result in police issuing tickets with fines up to $100, but not an arrest.The Oregon Health Authority’s site for the program said it will begin accepting applications for manufacturing licenses on January 2, 2023.The state agency confirmed Oregon has no licensed psilocybin facilitators or service centers at this time. But the agency said it’s not responsible for unregulated activity, including unlicensed possession, sale or consumption of psilocybin.That’s local law enforcement’s job, a health authority spokesperson said.Kevin Allen, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau, said via email Thursday that the agency’s Narcotics and Organized Crime unit is aware of the allegations being made online about the location, but referred questions to the Oregon Health Authority.“The nature of the (Narcotics and Organized Crime unit) work requires them to be pretty cautious about what they release publicly, so I can’t say more than the fact that they’re aware of it,” Allen said.The signage outside the store is a white speckled red top mushroom house with the solicitation: “Come shop with us for all your mushroom needs!”A menu board at Shroom House, 1541 W. Burnside St., features colorful names for strains of dried magic mushrooms.Shroom House, a Canadian company, calls itself an “online dispensary” with “mail-order magic mushrooms.” Representatives did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment Thursday. The website says users must be 19 or older to access.The Portland storefront appears to have popped up in the past few weeks.Inside, it looks like a dispensary or holistic shop: artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space. They even have T-shirts with the logo.Upon entry, customers are required to show two forms of I.D. – a driver’s license and debit or credit card – and fill out a form listing their name and address. They’re asked to become a member of the “Shroom House Society.”Then they can purchase recreational mushrooms with cash. Of course, there’s an ATM in the corner.Inside the new shrooms vending shop at 1541 W. Burnside St. artificial vines hang from rafters above, large planted pots adorn the cement floor and white wooden shelves are sparsely speckled with products in a clean, airy space.On the counter, next to a register, a clear glass jar has a written note taped to it: “A tip for your trip.”“This is crazy, everything Oregon is doing with decriminalization, I love it,” one customer who declined to give his name said on his way out. “I can’t see it being shut down,” he said, when asked if he was concerned about the legitimacy.Other customers inside the store Thursday afternoon expressed anxiety at a TV news crew outside. They said they learned about the shop on Reddit, where a user posted a new Portland billboard advertising the shop.The building at 1541 W. Burnside St. is owned by Sunjoy Realty, LLC, according to Secretary of State records. The property’s building manager, Mark Byrum, said the person who owns the new business started the lease within the past two months.There are no listed business in Oregon registered under the name Shroom House, according to the Secretary of State’s website.– Savannah Eadens; seadens@oregonian.com; 503-221-6651; @savannaheadensReporter Lizzy Acker contributed to this story.Our journalism needs your support.

Opinion: Undoing urban growth boundary isn’t the answer to our housing crisis,|By Guest Columnist || The Oregonian|,Opinion,|Updated: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:16 a.m.|||,|Published: Dec. 04, 2022, 6:15 a.m.|,None,|We don’t need to compromise our principles and sacrifice farms and forestlands to development to confront the housing crisis, the authors write. Oregonian file photoLC-NEW!By Guest Columnist || The OregonianSam Diaz, Kim McCarty and Steve MessinettiDiaz is executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon. McCarty is executive director of Community Alliance of Tenants. Messinetti is president and chief executive for Habitat for Humanity Portland Region.In his Nov. 12 column, “Need for housing exceeds all boundaries,” Steve Duin proposes that we address Oregon’s housing crisis by undoing the urban growth boundary. But simply opening up all of Oregon to development won’t solve our housing crisis, though it will exacerbate other challenges in the process. His “solution” will not result in housing options near existing schools, parks, jobs, stores and services that most Oregonians can afford.The urban growth boundary is an innovative policy for designating land for development that continues to achieve its goals of preventing climate-harming and congestion-inducing sprawl while protecting land that grows our food and offers us moments in nature. While improvements can be made to how local governments expand the boundaries, the main problem we face is a lack of equally innovative policies that support the development needed inside our existing urban footprint. Building housing has become more complicated with more expensive and lengthy permitting and land use processes. For many projects, the jurisdictional fees surpass the cost of the land. For example, when Habitat for Humanity develops housing in our region, permitting fees plus “System Development Charges” paid to local jurisdictions generally exceed the market-rate cost for land.Cities across the United States with no urban growth boundaries or zoning - including Houston, Dallas, and Boise - are experiencing similar housing shortages as Portland. Furthermore, previous expansions of the urban growth boundary in the Portland metro region have led to developments of more expensive homes on large lots far from jobs and public transportation - not the places affordable to live in that are so desperately in demand. The takeaway? The urban growth boundary isn’t the make-or-break lever for housing supply or affordability.If turning farms, forests and watersheds into subdivisions won’t solve our housing crisis, what will? We need a comprehensive approach that includes stabilizing renters at risk of eviction, land use policies that encourage density near jobs and transportation, funding to close racial disparities in home ownership, fast-track permitting and fee waivers to encourage affordable housing, and increasing availability of underutilized land within urban growth boundaries.Keep people housed. Expanding the urban growth boundary will not stop evictions and homelessness. The single most cost-effective way to address houselessness is to help prevent people from losing their homes in the first place. Portland State University’s Homeless Research and Action Center forecast at least 125,000 Oregon households at risk of eviction in 2021. It’s already happening – since January, monthly eviction filings have surged with hundreds more a month than in pre-pandemic times. In addition to increased rental assistance, we should look to offer free legal assistance for tenants; support small landlords; enact stronger renter protections; and encourage full utilization of our currently vacant housing.Promote balanced approaches to infill in all neighborhoods and welcome more neighbors. Oregon has landmark legislation to allow duplexes, triplexes and other multi-unit homes in all neighborhoods. Housing density near jobs, transit, schools, services, and community spaces reduces carbon emissions, makes transportation cheaper and more accessible and adds to the diversity and vibrancy of our neighborhoods. To help spur increased development, every jurisdiction should waive fees associated with development and streamline permitting for affordable housing development, with state and federal support when necessary.Give more Oregonians the opportunity to own their home. Even moderately priced housing options are out of reach for many people, especially for Oregonians of color and younger families, many of whom are scrambling to keep up with skyrocketing rents. A path forward is to restrict more properties to be permanently affordable through the community land trust model. In combination with a dedicated revenue stream from the state and local jurisdictions for down payment assistance and subsidies for affordable housing development, this model can facilitate homeownership for households earning low and moderate incomes.Locate and leverage land within the urban growth boundary. Look around our own cities and towns. We have large areas of vacant lands, underused parking lots and empty commercial spaces, all available for building homes. Portland has recently proposed to inventory City-owned land and make all appropriate parcels shovel-ready for affordable housing. Other public agencies should do the same.We don’t need to sacrifice our natural areas or farmland to meet the housing challenge. The real keys to unlocking housing supply and affordability lie within our urban growth boundaries.

|Sunflower sea stars need help after catastrophic population declines, scientists say|,By Associated Press,Environment,None,|Published: Dec. 03, 2022, 12:57 p.m.|,None,|Sunflower sea stars, which can span more than 3 feet, are predators to the kelp-eating sea urchin. Without them, sea urchin populations have exploded, causing a troubling decline in kelp forests that provide food and shelter to many aquatic species along the West Coast.Getty Images/Stocktrek ImagesNEW!By Associated PressScientists along the West Coast are calling for action to help sunflower sea stars, among the largest sea stars in the world, recover from catastrophic population declines.Experts say a sea star wasting disease epidemic that began in 2013 has decimated about 95% of the population from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, The Astorian reported.The decline triggered the International Union for Conservation of Nature to classify the species as critically endangered in 2020. A petition to list the species under the federal Endangered Species Act was filed in 2021.Steven Rumrill, shellfish program leader at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said in his more than 40 years as a marine scientist, he hasn’t seen a widespread decline of a species on the same scale as the sunflower sea star.The sea stars, which are among the largest in the world and can span more than 3 feet, are predators to the kelp-eating sea urchin. Without them, sea urchin populations have exploded, causing a troubling decline in kelp forests that provide food and shelter to many aquatic species along the West Coast.Rumrill contributed to a recently published roadmap to recovery for the sea star as a guide for scientists and conservationists.“It just sort of breaks your heart to see a species decline so rapidly to the point of extinction,” Rumrill said. “At the global scale, we’re recognizing that the impacts of humans have had major impacts on populations and lots of extinctions worldwide. Here’s one that’s happening right in front of our eyes.”The roadmap was completed in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, National Marine Fisheries Service, and state agencies in California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.The sea star wasting disease is estimated to have killed over 5.75 billion sunflower sea stars, according to the document.The source of the outbreak has not been conclusively identified, but the document points to evidence that warming ocean waters from human-caused climate change increases the severity of the disease and could have triggered the outbreak.Rumrill said listing through the Endangered Species Act could result in federal funding to continue research.Matthew Burks, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said whether the agency recommends the sea star be listed under the Endangered Species Act will be posted to the Federal Register by early next year.While sunflower sea stars appear to be the most affected by the sea star wasting disease, they are among about 20 documented species of sea stars at risk along the West Coast.-- The Associated PressIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Conservation group asks Oregon to revoke approvals for renewable diesel refinery on Columbia River,|By Ted Sickinger|| The Oregonian/OregonLive|,Business,None,|Published: Dec. 02, 2022, 7:00 a.m.|,125,|A rendering of the proposed renewable diesel refinery at Port Westward industrial park outside Clatskanie.NEW!125sharesBy Ted Sickinger|| The Oregonian/OregonLiveConservationists this week asked Oregon regulators to revoke state authorizations for a $2 billion-plus renewable diesel refinery proposed on the Columbia River near Clatskanie.Columbia Riverkeeper, which opposes siting the controversial renewable diesel refinery in the Columbia River estuary, argues that approval of the project should be called into question following a key decision in October by the state Land Use Board of Appeals.Columbia County commissioners in February approved land use permits for the project’s backer, Houston-based NEXT Renewables. But conservation groups and a local resident appealed that decision to the state land board, which ruled in late October that a proposed rail yard at the facility is not allowed on agricultural land, as planned.Columbia Riverkeeper is now arguing that the land use decision undercuts an air quality permit for the facility that the Department of Environmental Quality approved in August and a previously granted exemption from obtaining a site permit from the Department of Energy. Both of those are predicated on having land use approval from the county, so Columbia Riverkeeper believes they should be revoked.Michael Hinrichs, a spokesperson for the projects’ backers, Houston-based NEXT Renewables, said Columbia Riverkeeper is wrong. NEXT Renewables obtained two separate land use approvals from the county – one for the rail yard and another for the refining facility. The air quality permit is linked to the refinery not the rail yard, he said, so is not impacted by the land use decision.NEXT Renewables will redesign the rail yard so it conforms with land use laws and reapply for a new approval from the county, he added.“Columbia Riverkeeper’s claims are either disingenuous or simply uninformed,” Hinrichs said in an email.He pointed to a memo that DEQ Interim Director Leah Feldman sent to members of the Environmental Quality Commission in advance of the policy setting board’s regular meeting in mid-November that said the land use decision “does not affect” the air permit.Columbia Riverkeeper said it’s aware of the agency’s position, but believes it’s wrong.Dan Serres, conservation director for the group, said the rail facility is an integral part of the project, required for the delivery of feedstocks and other refinery supplies. The air permit, he said, lists the proposed rail activities as a source of emissions. Moreover, in a request for information to the company for another major permit, a water quality certification, DEQ said that consistency with land use regulations would require approvals for both the rail yard and refinery.“Bottom line: the refinery can’t operate without the rail yard,” Serres said in an email. “A company should not receive air or water permits in a situation where the underlying land use authorization is invalid.”DEQ spokesperson Lauren Wirtis said the agency will consult with the Department of Justice on the questions the organization is raising. Jennifer Kalez, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, said the agency is reviewing Columbia Riverkeeper’s position and expects to respond within the next week. “We will do our due diligence to evaluate how LUBA’s decision may affect the energy facility” she said.Columbia Riverkeeper said it is also looking at other legal avenues to dispute the validity of the air permit.Backers of the project are hoping to open the facility in 2024 and say it would create 3,500 temporary construction jobs, 240 permanent jobs during operation and generate more than $45 million in state and local tax revenue annually.Renewable diesel is a replacement for petroleum-based diesel that is refined from vegetable oil, animal fats, seed oil and waste grease. Backers of the project say the life-cycle greenhouse emissions are 80% lower than petroleum-based fuels. Meanwhile, transportation emissions account for the largest portion of Oregon’s emissions and have been the most difficult sector to achieve reductions in.Community members and conservation groups claim the project would pose a major pollution risk for the Port Westward community as well as those downwind and downstream from the refinery and railyard. They say DEQ’s analysis downplayed those risks.The facility expects to produce 1.6 million gallons a day of fuel at startup and 2.1 million gallons a day at full capacity. It would consume large amounts of natural gas in the process, with associated emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.- Ted Sickinger; tsickinger@oregonian.com; 503-221-8505; @tedsickingerIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
Spectators flock to Hawaii’s erupting Mauna Loa volcano,By The Associated Press,Environment,|Updated: Nov. 30, 2022, 11:26 a.m.|||,|Published: Nov. 30, 2022, 11:25 a.m.|,None,|Ingrid Yang, left, and Kelly Bruno, both of San Diego, take a photo in front of lava erupting from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022, near Hilo, Hawaii. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)APNEW!By The Associated PressThe first eruption in 38 years of Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is open 24 hours a day.“The viewing has been spectacular,” especially at night and before sunrise, park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane said.Visitors to the park are currently able to witness two eruptive events: the glow from Kilauea’s lava lake and lava from a Mauna Loa fissure.“This is a rare time where we have two eruptions happening simultaneously,” Ferracane said.Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. The current eruption is its 34th since written history began in 1843. Its smaller neighbor, Kilauea, has been erupting since September 2021.Officials were initially concerned that lava flowing down Mauna Loa would head toward the community of South Kona, but scientists later assured the public the eruption had migrated to a rift zone on the volcano’s northeast flank and wasn’t threatening communities.The lava was flowing “not super fast” at less than 1 mph, Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said Tuesday. It was moving downhill about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Saddle Road, which connects the eastern and western sides of Hawaii’s Big Island.The flow was likely to slow down about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from the road, when it hits flatter ground.It was not clear when or if the lava will reach the road. It could hit flatter ground later Tuesday or Wednesday, according to Hon.The smell of volcanic gases and sulfur was thick Tuesday along Saddle Road, where people watched the wide stream of lava creep closer. Clouds cleared to reveal a large plume of gas and ash rising from a vent on the mountain.Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation to allow responders to arrive quickly or limit access as needed.Lava crossed the Mauna Loa Observatory access road Monday night and cut off power to the facility, Hon said. It could move toward the county seat of Hilo, he added, but that could take a week or longer.Meanwhile, scientists are trying to measure the gas emitted from the eruption.“It’s just very early in this eruption right now,” Hon said.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano,  began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. (Chelsea Jensen/West Hawaii Today via AP)APNEW!By staff and wire reportsWashington state’s Mount St. Helens erupted catastrophically in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles away.Mauna Loa is not exploding like Mount St. Helens did. The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa and Mount St. Helens erupt in different ways,” said Liz Westby, a geologist based at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington. “Mauna Loa trends toward eruptions of fluid-flowing lava (compositionally called basalt), which over time, has built its broad shield shape.”In contrast, she said, “Mount St. Helens trends toward eruptions of thicker, more viscous lava (compositionally called dacite and andesite) that doesn’t flow very far and can pile up near the vent to form lava domes. Gases can be trapped in the thick and viscous magma as it waits in the shallow magma reservoir and the systems can become pressurized, sometimes leading to explosive eruptions.”Westby added, “With lava flowing from fissures high on the flank of Mauna Loa, the chance of an explosive eruption is greatly diminished (gases are escaping).”Mauna Loa’s hotter, drier and more fluid magma allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is called a shield volcano because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.On Friday, the United States Geological Service posted a routine update on Northwest volcanoes:Activity Update: All volcanoes in the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington are at normal background levels of activity. These include Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams in Washington State; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Newberry, and Crater Lake in Oregon.Recent Observations: Over the past week, earthquakes were located at Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Hood, including a seismic swarm at Mount St. Helens from November 20–21 and a M 2.1 earthquake at Mount Rainier on November 21. These earthquakes are consistent with background levels of seismicity at each volcano. Activity at other Cascade volcanoes is also at background levels.Westby noted Mauna Loa has historically had explosive eruptions, although not like Mount St. Helens’ 1980 lateral blast, and Mount St. Helens has had fluid flows of basalt. The Ape Cave lava tube on the south side of Mount St. Helens is an example of a basalt flow, she said.New Webcam shows fissure 3!! https://t.co/nWh9jyd4XJNWRZ eruption #MaunaLoa continues.

On the Big Island, the first eruption in 38 years of the world’s largest active volcano dredged up bad memories among some Hawaii residents who have been through harrowing volcanic experiences in the past.It was just four years ago that Nicole Skilling fled her home near a community where more than 700 residences were destroyed by lava. She relocated to the South Kona area, only to find herself packing her car with food and supplies this week after Mauna Loa erupted late Sunday.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks. Hon expects the current eruption to follow this pattern.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

(AP Photo/Caleb Jones)APNEW!By The Associated PressLava is shooting 100 feet to 200 feet into the air as Hawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupts for the first time in nearly 40 years.For now, lava is not threatening any homes or communities and no evacuation orders have been issued. Lava could eventually reach neighborhoods as it flows downhill though it could take a week or more for molten rock to reach populated areas.Mauna Loa is spewing sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases. They form volcanic smog, or vog, when they mix with vapor, oxygen and dust in sunlight. As a result, state health officials are urging people to cut back on outdoor exercise and other activities that cause heavy breathing.Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Its smaller, more active neighbor, Kilauea volcano, has been erupting continuously for more than a year since September 2021.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA?Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest (that title goes to Mauna Kea) but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass.It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean.Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. The current eruption is its 34th since written history began in 1843.The Big Island is mostly rural and hosts cattle ranches and coffee farms but it is also home to a few small cities, including the county seat of Hilo, which has a population of 45,000.It’s about 200 miles south of Hawaii’s most populous island, Oahu, where the state capital, Honolulu, and beach resort Waikiki are both located.Mauna Loa’s volume is estimated to be at least 18,000 cubic miles, making it the world’s largest volcano when measured from the ocean floor to its summit.IS MAUNA LOA EXPLODING LIKE MOUNT ST. HELENS?Mauna Loa is not exploding like Washington state’s Mount St. Helens did in 1980, killing 57 people. That eruption sent ash soaring over 80,000 feet and raining down as far as 250 miles (400 kilometers) away.The magma in Mount St. Helens tends to be stickier and traps more gas, making it much more likely to explode when it rises. It’s of a variety called composite volcanoes, which form concave cones.Mauna Loa’s magma tends to be hotter, drier and more fluid. That allows the magma’s gas to escape and lava to flow down the side the volcano the way it is starting to do now. Mauna Loa is a shield volcano, named because the long, broad flanks built by repeated lava flows give it the appearance of a warrior’s shield.In 1989, Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano, another composite volcano, belched an 8-mile cloud of ash that clogged all four engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet. The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines restarted and the plane landed without injury to the 245 people aboard.Mauna Loa released some ash this time but on a vastly smaller scale than these examples from composite volcanoes.WHERE IS MAUNA LOA ERUPTING FROM?The eruption began Sunday night at its summit after a series of large earthquakes. It then spread to vents that formed in a rift zone where the mountain is splitting apart and it’s easier for magma to emerge.These vents are on the mountain’s northeast side and lava emerging there could head toward Hilo, which is on the east side of the island.Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said he doesn’t expect additional vents to form on the volcano’s southwest rift zone during this eruption. That means communities to the west would be spared lava flows this time.Mauna Loa also erupted from the northeast in 1984. That time, lava headed toward Hilo but stopped a few miles short of the city.Historically, each Mauna Loa eruption has lasted a few weeks. Hon expects the current eruption to follow this pattern.The ground is shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating that it could erupt. Scientists say they don't expect that to happen right away but officials on the Big Island of Hawaii are telling residents to be prepared in case it does erupt soon. This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island.APWHAT HAZARDS ARE POSED BY MAUNA LOA’S ERUPTION?-Lava: Molten rock could cover houses, farms or neighborhoods, depending on where it flows. But lava from the northeast rift zone will likely take at least a week to reach populated areas, allowing people time to evacuate if needed.-Volcanic gas: Mauna Loa is releasing volcanic gases, mostly sulfur dioxide. The gases are present in their highest concentrations in the immediate area around the summit crater or vents. But they also combine with other particles to form vog, which can spread across the Big Island and even waft over to the state’s other islands.Vog can give healthy people burning eyes, headaches and sore throats. It can send those with asthma or other respiratory problems to the hospital.-Glass particles: When hot lava erupts from a fissure and rapidly cools, it forms glass particles named “Pele’s hair” and “Pele’s tears” after the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.The particles tend not to travel far from volcanic vents — maybe only a few hundred yards or a mile — and won’t threaten many people, said Aaron Pietruszka, an associate specialist at the University of Hawaii’s Department of Earth Sciences.“It just literally looks like hair strands. And that’s where the fluid lava is stretched by the wind to make long, thin strands,” said Pietruszka.The glass bits — as short as a few millimeters or as long as a few inches — can be sharp.“You wouldn’t want to be digging your hands in it because you could get a cut,” Pietruszka said.An N95 or KF94 mask would protect against these glass particles but not against volcanic gas, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health.“Pele’s hair” specimens from Kilauea volcano’s eruption are visible at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE MAUNA LOA’S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS?Mauna Loa released about 15,000 tons of carbon dioxide per day during its 1984 eruption, according to USGS data.That’s equivalent to the annual emissions from 2,400 sport utility vehicles.Scientists say all of Earth’s volcanoes combined emit less than one percent of the carbon dioxide that humans produce each year.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|The U.S. promised tribes they would always have fish; they do, but the fish pose toxic risks|,|By Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublica|,Native American News,None,|Published: Nov. 29, 2022, 8:40 a.m.|,224,|Lottie Sam, front right, and other women prepare salmon in Toppenish, Wash., before a ceremony held by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Credit:Tony Schick/OPBNEW!224sharesBy Tony Schick, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Maya Miller, ProPublicaThis article was originally published by ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Oregon Public Broadcasting.Salmon heads, fins and tails filled baking trays in the kitchen where Lottie Sam prepped for her tribe’s spring feast.The sacred ceremony, held each year on the Yakama reservation in south-central Washington, honors the first returning salmon and the first gathered roots and berries of the new year.“The only thing we don’t eat is the bones and the teeth, but everything else is sucked clean,” Sam said, laughing.Her mother and grandmother taught her that salmon is a gift from the creator, a source of strength and medicine that is first among all foods on the table. They don’t waste it.“The skin, the brain, the head, the jaw, everything of the salmon,” she said. “Everybody’s gonna have the opportunity to consume that, even if it’s the eyeball.”Sam is a member of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. They are among several tribes with a deep connection to salmon in the Columbia River Basin, a region that drains parts of the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, southward through seven U.S. states into the West’s largest river.Sacred Rivers by The Associated PressIt’s also a region contaminated by more than a century of industrial and agricultural pollution, leaving Sam and others to weigh unknown health risks against sacred practices.“We just know that if we overconsume a certain amount of it that it might have possible risks,” Sam said, as she gutted salmon in the bustling kitchen. “It’s our food. We don’t see it any other way.”But while tribes have pushed the government to pay closer attention to contamination, that hasn’t happened. Regulators have done so little testing for toxic chemicals in fish that even public health and environmental agencies admit they don’t have enough information to prioritize cleanup efforts or to fully inform the public about human health risks.So Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica did our own testing, and we found what public health agencies have not: Native tribes in the Columbia River Basin face a disproportionate risk of toxic exposure through their most important food.OPB and ProPublica purchased 50 salmon from Native fishermen along the Columbia River and paid to have them tested at a certified lab for 13 metals and two classes of chemicals known to be present in the Columbia. We then showed the results to two state health departments, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials and tribal fisheries scientists.The testing showed concentrations of two chemicals in the salmon that the EPA and both Oregon and Washington’s health agencies deem unsafe at the levels consumed by many of the 68,000-plus Native people who are members of tribes living in the Columbia River Basin today. Those chemicals are mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which after prolonged exposure can damage the immune and reproductive systems and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.The general population eats so little fish that agencies do not consider it at risk, which means that government protocols are mostly failing to protect tribal health. In fact, the contaminants pose an unacceptable health risk if salmon is consumed even at just over half the rate commonly reported by tribal members today, according to guidelines from the EPA and Washington Department of Health.The potential for exposure extends along the West Coast, where hundreds of thousands of people face increased risks of cancer and other health problems just by adhering to the salmon-rich diet their cultures were built upon.A spring chinook from the Columbia River at the mouth to the Oregon Washington border. Chinook salmon, like the ones OPB and ProPublica sampled, migrate to sea over the course of their lives, where they pick up contaminants that Northwest waters like the Columbia and other rivers deposit in the ocean. EPA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that even with minimal data available, agency staff members have flagged the potential for exposure to chemicals in salmon caught not just in the Columbia but also Washington’s Puget Sound, British Columbia’s Skeena and Fraser rivers, and California’s Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.Tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding millions of acres but preserving their perpetual right to their “usual and accustomed” fishing areas; the Supreme Court later likened this right to being as important to Native people as the air they breathe.The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River.(Mark Graves/Staff)LC-But time and again, the U.S. has not upheld those treaties. Damming the Columbia River destroyed tribal fishing grounds and, along with habitat loss and overfishing, drove many salmon populations to near extinction, wiping some out entirely. Previous reporting has shown how the federal government failed in its promises to compensate tribes for those losses and in some cases worked against tribes’ efforts to restore salmon populations. In addition, the EPA has allowed cleanups to languish, and state regulators have been slow to rein in industrial pollution. That toxic pollution impairs the ability of salmon to swim, feed and reproduce.Continually poor and declining salmon numbers have prompted the White House to acknowledge an environmental justice crisis in the Columbia River Basin.The results of our testing for toxic chemicals point to yet another failure.A Toxic MysteryQuestions over fish safety go back generations in some tribal families, predating government concerns by decades.Karlen Yallup remembers tribal elders telling her the water had been clean enough to drink at Celilo Falls, their primary fishing site on the Columbia River. Yallup’s great-great-grandparents, members of the Warm Springs tribe, lived near the falls and would fish there every day.Voices

CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF WARM SPRINGS
On her relationship with salmon: “My grandma’s grandma … fished all day – gave thanks, treated the salmon with respect. … Then, [the area where they fished] was flooded. It was very devastating to the tribes. … Salmon would face some of the hardest times they would ever face. When the salmon is gone, we are gone.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “So you first start by finely mashing the salmon up, and then you add the beaten eggs into the salmon, and then you salt and pepper it through the whole thing, then you shape the patties and put it in flour, make sure it’s fully covered and put it on the pan.”As the industrial revolution boomed, farming, industry and urban sprawl grew throughout the basin. In 1957, the falls were submerged by water that pooled behind The Dalles Dam — one of 18 built on the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake River, to turn the river into a shipping channel, irrigate farmland and generate hydroelectricity. By then, pollution from those new industries had dirtied the water.Tribal elders told Yallup they knew the water was no longer clean enough to drink when they could see changes and hear differences in the way it ran. They also worried about the health impacts of Hanford, a sprawling nuclear weapons production complex dozens of miles upstream. Hanford became one of dozens of heavily polluted sites across the Columbia basin, considered one of the largest and most expensive toxic cleanups in the world.Yallup said her elders began to suspect that whatever was getting into the water was getting into the fish. They became “very worried about the salmon getting the family sick,” she said.It wasn’t until the 1990s, however, that the government and the broader public drew attention to the risk to people eating those fish.In 1992, despite two decades of improving water quality under the Clean Water Act, an EPA study found chemicals embedded in carp from the Columbia River. The results alarmed the region’s tribes, which responded by working with the agency to test more fish and survey members about their fish consumption rates.Those efforts revealed that tribal people, on average, eat six to 11 times more fish than non-tribal members. They also detected more than 92 different contaminants in the fish, some at levels high enough to harm human health.In the years that followed, EPA staff expressed concerns over toxic contamination in report after report, but little happened in response. The issue officially became an agency priority during the administration of President George W. Bush, but the EPA repeatedly fell short of its goals to clean up toxic sites as responsible parties fought over how much it would cost, who would pay and how quickly it needed to be done.Voices

On his relationship with salmon: “My father and mother taught me how to do this. Same with my grandparents. A long time ago, we cooked on alderwood. We get a stick or something and poke through the salmon, and then we’ll cook it on top of, right next to, a fire.”
How he likes to prepare salmon: “Usually I like it when they make dumplings … and then make ‘em kind of like soup. How I make dumplings usually just get a pot, you can put it like halfway or fill it up all the way with water and once that boils, then you can get canned salmon or smoked salmon and break it up in there. Then you can either put a can of corn or dried corn. … Then once that boils down a little bit, then that’s when I would try to be done with the dough, which is just flour and water. Then you break off pieces into the pot.”The agency also never had the money to fulfill its plans for continuous monitoring, said Mary Lou Soscia, the Columbia River coordinator for the EPA, leaving the agency unable to determine whether the river was getting cleaner.“Nobody wanted to pay attention to toxics,” said Soscia, who has been working on river cleanup since the late 1990s. “But there are small amounts of studies that give us like those yellow blinking lights. And when tribal people eat so much fish, it’s something we have to be really, really concerned about.”A member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs prepares wind-dried salmon the traditional way, inside a drying shack, in September 2021.

Credit:Arya Surowidjojo/OPBFinally, Oregon delivered in 2011 what was hailed as a breakthrough moment: It adopted new water-quality standards to protect tribal people’s health. The state vowed to restrict the amount of chemicals released by industrial facilities and wastewater plants so that people could eat over a third of a pound of fish per day without increasing their risk of health problems. That amount of fish was based on a survey of tribal members done in the 1990s.Other states that share the Columbia River or its tributaries were slow to follow suit. Washington waited a decade to adopt equally protective standards; Idaho and Montana still have not.But while Oregon was ahead of its neighbors, state regulators took few steps to ensure polluters actually met the state’s new limits. For as many as half the contaminants at issue, the state said it didn’t have the technology to measure whether polluters met the new stricter criteria.The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality also said it didn’t have the staff to keep pollution permits updated. It let more than 80% of polluters operate with expired permits, meaning they weren’t even being held to new standards.When asked in September for evidence of how the state’s highly touted standard has actually improved water quality, the DEQ said it “does not have significant amounts of data on the concentration of bioaccumulative pollutants in the Columbia River, and therefore does not have any trend information.”Jennifer Wigal, DEQ’s water quality administrator, said the standards were implemented not because of pollution but to ensure that tribal diets were represented.Voices

On her relationship with salmon: “I don’t think we would be here without this food. … Our parents or grandparents just taught us this way, you know, as we were growing up. … So now it’s a habitual thing. … It’s a delicacy, it has nutrients, it has medicine … and so, even today, in 2022, we’re still going to consume it.”
How she likes to prepare salmon: “Canning, I’ve been doing it for a long time so it’s simple to me. … Start with fresh salmon, then I add a little bit of salt and pepper. … It’s best to use a pressure canner. … You cut the salmon to fit in the jars, add the salt and pepper, clean the rim of the jar and make sure there are no cracks or anything, and you have to seal the lid.”Wigal also said that when companies release harmful contaminants into the river, most are at such low concentrations that they are below the agency’s ability to detect them. Additionally, most of the contamination affecting fish, the DEQ said, comes not from those polluters but from runoff and erosion from industries like agriculture and logging.But the DEQ also has yet to curtail that source of pollution. Along the Willamette River, which flows through Oregon’s most populated areas and feeds into the Columbia, the EPA determined last year that the state needed to cut mercury pollution from these sources by at least 88% if it was going to meet its standards for protecting human health.Congress tried to take matters into its own hands, but it fell into the same pattern of bold plans and delayed action. In 2016 it amended the Clean Water Act, the seminal law governing water pollution nationwide, to require the EPA to establish a program dedicated to restoring the Columbia. It took four years and a nudge from the Government Accountability Office for the program to actually begin. That same year, in 2020, an EPA regional staffer found that broad swaths of the river were polluted with toxic chemicals and were below the standards of the Clean Water Act.In an emailed response to questions, the EPA repeatedly said Congress gave the agency orders to clean up the Columbia but failed to provide the agency with funding to carry out the work. Even after the agency designated the Columbia an EPA priority, finally elevating the river to the same status as other major ecosystems like the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, it received no additional funding and staff for cleanup or long-term monitoring.“That needs to happen,” Soscia, the agency’s Columbia River coordinator, said. “It hasn’t happened.”A Disproportionate RiskHad the government followed through on its plans for monitoring, it might have found what OPB and ProPublica’s testing revealed: that contamination was high enough that it would warrant at least one of the state health agencies to recommend eating no more than eight 8-ounce servings of salmon in a month.For non-tribal people, who on average eat less than those eight monthly servings, the risk is minute. But surveys show members of some tribes in the Columbia River Basin on average eat twice as much fish as the agency’s recommended eight monthly servings.The testing also revealed the potential for increased cancer risks from PCBs and another class of chemicals known as dioxins. Given an average Columbia River tribal diet, according to recent surveys commissioned by the EPA, the risk is as much as five times higher than what the EPA considers sufficiently protective of public health. This means that, based on the news organizations’ samples, roughly 1 of every 20,000 people would be diagnosed with cancer as a result of eating the average tribal diet — about 16 servings of fish each month — over the course of a lifetime.The harm goes beyond the raw numbers. That’s because the risk is compounded by exposure from other fish and other toxic chemicals, such as pesticides and flame retardants in those same waters, that weren’t included in OPB and ProPublica’s testing because of cost constraints. Those chemicals are known to accumulate in fish. Beyond fish contamination, tribal populations already experience disproportionately high rates of certain cancers.Public health officials caution that any cancer risks must be weighed against the many health benefits of eating fish, including the potential to lower the risk of heart disease. The Oregon and Washington health departments, like those of many states, do not assess cancer risk when setting public health advisories.We showed the result of our testing to public health officials in both Washington and Oregon. Both groups said they would be taking further steps to assess salmon and the exposure risk to tribes.Emerson Christie, a toxicologist with the Washington Department of Health who analyzed the results, said the department will consider whether to issue an official public health advisory based on the news organizations’ findings. “These results do indicate that there’s a potential for a fish advisory,” Christie said.David Farrer, an Oregon Health Authority toxicologist who also reviewed the results, said the agency would coordinate with state environmental regulators and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission about additional testing or potential advisories.Public health advisories and cooking guidance are a last-resort attempt to protect people when larger cleanup efforts fall short or don’t happen at all.These advisories can also be plagued with delays. When tribes collected and tested tissue from the Pacific lamprey back in 2009, they found that the culturally important eel-like fish contained dangerous levels of mercury and PCBs. The Oregon Health Authority responded by issuing a consumption warning in October — but the process took 13 years.And while advisories put constraints on tribes’ traditional diets, they don’t help with the larger issue: that the waters from which they are eating fish are still contaminated — with no plan to clean them up.“The long-term solution to this problem isn’t keeping people from eating contaminated fish — it’s keeping fish from being contaminated in the first place,” Aja DeCoteau, executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, said when the lamprey advisory was issued.Wilbur Slockish Jr. is a longtime fisherman who serves on the inter-tribal fish commission.It is wrong, Slockish said, for the government to allow pollution and then, instead of cleaning it up, decide it can tell people not to eat the fish they always have.“That’s on the back of our people’s health, the health of the land, the health of the water,” he said. “We’re not disposable.”A Fight Too Big to IgnoreSlockish eats a lot of fish.He relies on stockpiles of jarred, dried or smoked salmon to get him through the winter. He said it’s not uncommon for him to eat more than a pound of salmon or lamprey in one sitting, sometimes multiple times per day.He’s a direct descendant of the Klickitat tribe’s Chief Sla-kish, who signed the Yakama Treaty of 1855, guaranteeing his people’s right to the fish. At that time, studies estimate that, on average, Native people in the region ate five to 10 times more fish than they do today. Slockish is not going to stop eating fish because of warnings about chemical contamination.He doesn’t see the alternatives as any better. Many in his family have struggled with heart disease, diabetes and cancer. He connects it to their being forced away from the river and made to eat government-issued commodity foods full of preservatives.“All of our foods were medicine,” he said. “Because there were no chemicals.”Research across the globe has connected the loss of traditional diets with spikes in health problems for Indigenous populations. In one West Coast tribe, the Karuk of Northern California, researchers found a direct link between families’ loss of access to salmon and increased prevalence of diabetes and heart disease.Public health experts agree that wild salmon, wherever it’s caught, remains one of the healthiest sources of protein available, and that chemicals can also contaminate other foods beyond just fish.Tribal leaders also worry more about their members getting too little fish than too much of it. And because salmon are a primary income source for many tribal fishers, they worry that fears over fish safety will drive away customers.But for Columbia River tribes, fish are also a cultural fixture, present at every ceremony. They are shared as customary gifts. Babies teethe on lamprey tails. Salmon heads and backbones are boiled into medicinal broths for the sick and elderly.Tribes up and down the river continue to fight for their right to a traditional diet and to clean fish.Yallup, from the Warm Springs tribe, decided to become an advocate for salmon after hearing from her grandmothers how much more limited their traditions had become.She’s on track to graduate in December from Portland’s Lewis & Clark Law School. Yallup chose the law profession to fight for salmon, she said, and to change laws to protect the river from pollution.“If I had a choice, I would just be a fisherman. I felt the responsibility to have to leave the reservation and have to go to law school,” Yallup said. “It’s such a big fight now. It’s kind of impossible to ignore.”Earlier this year, tribes successfully lobbied for one of their Columbia River fishing sites just east of Portland, known as Bradford Island, to be added to the list of polluted places eligible for cleanup money from the federal Superfund program.In August, the EPA received $79 million to reduce toxic pollution in the Columbia River as part of President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It is the most money ever dedicated to reducing Columbia River contamination. It’s also a fraction of what tribes and advocates say is needed.The Yakama Nation is using some of that EPA money to lead a pilot study into the kind of long-term monitoring that has been a recognized need for decades.Laura Klasner Shira, an environmental engineer for Yakama Nation Fisheries, said the tribe put together four federal grants to pay for its pilot study, which is limited to the area around Bonneville Dam, east of Portland. They hope someday it could grow to span nearly the entire length of the Columbia, up to the Canadian border. But it took 10 years to get as far as they are now.“It’s disappointing that the tribes have to take on this work,” she said, noting that government agencies not only have treaty and legal responsibilities but better funding. “The tribes have been the strongest advocates with the least resources.”They will sample resident fish, young salmon on their way to the ocean, and adult salmon after they’ve returned.They have two years to finish the work. After that, funding for their monitoring becomes a question mark.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|

This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island.APNEW!By The Associated PressWaves of orange, glowing lava and smoky ash erupted Monday from the world’s largest active volcano and people living on Hawaii’s Big Island were warned to be ready if their communities are threatened.The eruption of Mauna Loa wasn’t immediately endangering towns, but officials told residents to be ready to evacuate if lava flows started heading toward populated areas.Many now living in the area weren’t around when Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. The U.S. Geological Survey warned the roughly 200,000 people on the Big Island that an eruption “can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly.”Lifelong Big Island resident Bobby Camara, who lives in Volcano Village, said everyone across the island should be alert and keep track of the eruption.“I think everybody should be a little bit concerned,” he said. “We don’t know where the flow is going, we don’t know how long it’s going to last.”He said he’s seen three Mauna Loa eruptions in his lifetime and knows that people need to be vigilant.The eruption began late Sunday night following a series of fairly large earthquakes, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.Gunner Mench, who owns an art gallery in Kamuela, said he awoke shortly after midnight and saw an alert on his phone about the eruption.Mench and his wife, Ellie, ventured out to film the eruption’s eerie red glow over the island and watched as the lava spilled down the side of the volcano.“You could see it spurting up into the air, over the edge of this depression,” Mench said.“Right now it’s just entertainment, but the concern is” it could reach populated areas, he said.Lava pours out of the summit crater of Mauna Loa about 6:35 a.m. Monday, Nov. 28, 2022, as seen from Gilbert Kahele Recreation Area on Maunakea, Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano,  began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. (Chelsea Jensen/West Hawaii Today via AP)APThere’s been a surge of development on the Big Island in recent decades — its population has more than doubled, from 92,000 in 1980.More than a third of the island’s residents live either in the city of Kailua-Kona to the west of the volcano, which has about 23,000 people, and Hilo to the east, with about 45,000. Officials were most worried about several subdivisions about 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south of the volcano, which are home to about 5,000 people.A time-lapse video of the eruption from overnight showed lava lighting up one area, moving across it like waves on the ocean.The U.S. Geological Survey said that the eruption had migrated to a rift zone on the volcano’s northeast flank. Rift zones are where the mountain rock is cracked and relatively weak — making it easier for magma to emerge.An eruption from the northeast could send lava toward the county seat of Hilo or other towns in East Hawaii but it could take the lava weeks or months to reach populated areas. It’s possible the eruption may later shift to a rift zone on the southwest flank. Lava emerging from this area could reach nearby communities in hours or days.“We don’t want to try and second-guess the volcano,” Hon said. “We have to let it actually show us what it’s going to do and then we inform people of what is happening ASAP.”Hawaii County Civil Defense announced that it had opened shelters because it had reports of people evacuating from along the coast on their own initiative.The average Mauna Loa eruption is not typically prolonged, lasting a couple of weeks, Hon said.“Typically, Mauna Loa eruptions start off with the heaviest volume first,” Hon said. “After a few days, it starts to calm down a little bit.”The USGS warned residents who could be threatened by Mauna Loa lava flows to review their eruption preparations. Scientists had been on alert because of a recent spike in earthquakes at the summit of the volcano, which last erupted in 1984.Portions of the Big Island were under an ashfall advisory issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu, which said up to a quarter-inch (0.6 centimeters) of ash could accumulate in some areas.Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago.Mauna Loa, rising 13,679 feet (4,169 meters) above sea level, is the much larger neighbor of Kilauea, which erupted in a residential neighborhood and destroyed 700 homes in 2018. Some of Mauna Loa’s slopes are much steeper than Kilauea’s, so lava can flow much faster when it erupts.During a 1950 eruption, the mountain’s lava traveled 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the ocean in fewer than three hours.Tourism is Hawaii’s economic engine but Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth predicted few problems for those on vacation during the eruption.“It will be spectacular where it is, but the chances of it really interrupting the visitor industry — very, very slim,” he said.For some, the eruption might cut down on some travel time, even if there is more volcanic smog caused by higher sulfur-dioxide emissions.“But the good thing is you don’t have to drive from Kona over to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to see an eruption anymore,” Roth said. “You can just look out your window at night and you’ll be able to see Mauna Loa erupting.”Julia Neal, owner of Pahala Plantation Cottages, said the eruption brings some relief after many preparedness meetings, and much wondering about what the volcano will do.“It’s exciting,” she said. “It’s kind of a relief that it’s happening and we’re not waiting for it to happen.”A few future guests from the U.S. mainland called Neal “asking me to make a prediction, which I can’t,” she said. “So I said, just stand by.”___Associated Press writers Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu, Alina Hartounian in Phoenix and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.|
|Gorge commission elects Carina Miller, first Indigenous chair|,|By Gosia Wozniacka || The Oregonian/OregonLive|,News,|Updated: Nov. 28, 2022, 4:15 p.m.|||,|Published: Nov. 28, 2022, 4:02 p.m.|,175,|Carina Miller, a member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, was elected as the chair of the Columbia River Gorge Commission – the 35-year-old commission's first indigenous chair.Photo by LaRonn KatchiaNEW!175sharesBy Gosia Wozniacka || The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe Columbia River Gorge Commission has elected an Indigenous chair – a first for the 35-year-old commission that has had scant tribal leadership.Carina Miller, a member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, will help the commission balance its sometimes competing missions: to protect the natural beauty of the 292,000-acre Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and to advance the area’s economic development.The scenic area, known for incredible waterfalls, plants and wildlife diversity, and endangered salmon runs, has been home to Indigenous people for millennia. Though tribes ceded lands in the scenic area as part of their treaties with the U.S. government, tribal members retain the rights to fish and gather roots and berries and continue to have a strong link with the river.Miller has served as commissioner since her appointment by Gov. Kate Brown in 2019. She is currently one of three tribal members serving on the 13-member commission. The others are commission vice-chair Pah-tu Pitt, also a Warm Springs member, and commissioner Jerry Meninick, a Yakama Nation elder. Both were appointed by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.That’s a significant rise in tribal representation for a commission that has had just a handful of Indigenous commissioners. Louie Pitt, Pah-tu Pitt’s father, was the first Indigenous person appointed to the commission in 1993. A total of five Indigenous leaders have served on the commission.Miller said her appointment as chair is significant because “the state of Oregon has had a history of not fully supporting tribal sovereignty or always being a good political ally.”The commission, established in 1987 by the states of Oregon and Washington, sets policy for protecting non-federal lands in the gorge. It also serves as an appeals board for land-use decisions in the area. Its forthcoming task: approving the first climate change action plan for the gorge, as mandated by the management plan approved two years ago.Miller, who will take over as chair in January, has a background in economic development. As one of the youngest members of the tribal council at Warm Springs, she worked to bring marijuana cultivation and carbon markets to the reservation. She currently works for nonprofit Vibrant Tribal Economies, studying tribal economic health.Miller remembers visiting the scenic area as a child with her grandmother and great-grandmother, who taught her about the removal of the tribes and instilled the importance of the river to tribal identity. She also learned to be innovative to carry on tribal values, including by working within a system that has long oppressed Native people.“My grandmas really wanted me to be visible, but they also didn’t want us to be tokens,” said Miller. “They (taught me) that even though these systems were built to destroy us, that we had to really go in and understand them, master them, and find different ways forward, better ways.”– Gosia Wozniacka; gwozniacka@oregonian.com; @gosiawozniackaOur journalism needs your support.
